This means that there won't be mountains of dishes to be either hand cleaned or packed into the dishwasher (or if you're like me-both) later. You're able to spend less time cleaning as you spent time slaving over a hot cooker. Oh wait! Ensure time slaving over a hot stove. After clean up is complete you can get back to enjoying the sunshine set, chasing the lightening bugs with your little ones, or even waiting for the first celebrity.

While there'll be no one size fits all best cooking system, crock pot cooking comes really near. When you have a crock pot collecting dust somewhere at the back of your pantry it's the right time to get it out, dust off, and dig up some amazing summer crock pot cooking recipes.
