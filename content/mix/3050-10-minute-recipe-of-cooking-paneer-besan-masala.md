<i>Before you jump to Paneer Besan Masala recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about {<strong>The Simple Ways to Be Healthy</strong>.</i>
Becoming A Healthy Eater

    
Camp cooking can be as complicated or simple as you would like it to be. If you wish to prepare fast and simple but healthy meals as you are swimming, camp cooking does not even need to need a flame. However, if you are considering fueling your camping excursion using a feast, then camp cooking can allow you to make warm, healthy foods that are as good as you can create them at home in your kitchen.

 Almost any cooking system you are using in the kitchen can be duplicated around the campfire. For example, use a dutch oven or pit cooking to consume your food. You could also easily fry foods in a pan over a grill, or boil, braise and roast. Which sort of camping cookware is ideal for you? Camp cooking and clean-up may be easy or a hassle, and it all starts with great camping equipment.

Some pots/pans arrive in sets that partner together or"nest" for storage and even allow you to tuck a spoonful of gas within them. This really comes in handy once you're seeking to save space whilst camping.

Following are some camping items to consider with you if you are planning on preparing some meals around the campfire. These common kitchen items allow you to replicate yummy meals when you're out of doors.

• Salt and pepper
• Other your favorite herbs and spices
• Cooking oil
• Pot holder
• Hand-held can opener
• Aluminum foil

• Cutting knives
• Cutting board
• Mixing bowl


When you have only a couple campers and are looking for some easy camp cooking, try the simple and speedy technique of tin could cooking. All you'll need is a clean tin can -- a one gallon size can works nicely. Your source of heat may be small campfire, or if wood burning is prohibited, a little buddy burner may work well, which may be seen at sporting good stores or online. Place your meal from the tin can and just heat the contents of your own can over a flame.  This technique works great for soups, beans and tuna fish.

A more time-consuming pub cooking technique that also produces yummy meals is pit cooking. Pit cooking is great for items which could be wrapped in aluminum foil to be cooked.  It is also a great camp cooking method if you're using a dutch oven or cast iron cookware. Pit cooking warms your food by heating rocks and coals which are buried in the floor. As the stones cool away, their emitted heat cooks the meals. To pit cookfirst dig a hole that is about three times larger than your cookware. Line the pit with rocks and build a fire in the center. Once the fire has burned rapidly for approximately one hourpush the hot coals and stones into the middle. Twist your wrapped food or covered skillets in addition to the rocks and coals and place more on top. Following a number of hours, you will have some delicious camp food to enjoy.
