Becoming A Healthy Eater

    
Camp cooking can be as elaborate or simple as you want it to be. If you would like to prepare fast and simple but nutritious meals when you're swimming, camp cooking doesn't even need to require a flame. However, if you're thinking about fueling your camping trip with a feast, camp cooking can enable you to earn hot, healthy foods that are as great as you can create them at home in your kitchen.

Camp cooking does not need to be limited to sandwiches and baked potatoes wrapped in aluminum foil.  Just about any cooking process you are using from the kitchen could be replicated around the home. For example, use a dutch oven or pit cooking to consume your meals. You may also easily bake foods in a bowl over a grill, or boil, braise and beverage. Which kind of camping cookware is ideal for you? Camp cooking and cleanup can be easy or a hassle, it all starts with great camping gear.

Some pots/pans arrive in sets that mate together or"nest" for storage and also let you tuck a spoonful of fuel inside them. This comes in handy when you're looking to save room whilst camping.

Listed below are some camping things to consider with you if you're planning on preparing some meals around the campfire. These common kitchen items allow you to replicate yummy meals as you are out of doors.


• Other of your favorite herbs and spices
• Cooking oil
• Pot holder
• Hand-held can opener
• Aluminum foil

• Cutting knives
• Cutting board
• Mixing bowl


In case you have just a few campers and are searching for some very easy camp cooking, try out the simple and fast technique of tin may cooking. All you will need is a fresh tin can -- a 1 gallon size can works well. Your source of heat can be a small campfire, or if wood burning is illegal, a small buddy burner may work nicely, which may be located at sporting good stores or online. Put your meal in the tin could and just warm the contents of your can over a fire. You will have a hot meal ready in minutes.  This technique works great for soups, beans and tuna fish.

A more time-consuming camp cooking technique which also produces tasty meals is pit cooking.  It is also a excellent camp cooking system if you are using a dutch oven or cast iron cookware. Pit cooking warms your food by heating rocks and coals which are concealed in the ground. As the rocks cool , their emitted heat cooks the meals. To pit cook, first dig a hole that is approximately three times bigger than your own cookware. Line the pit with rocks and construct a fire in the center. When the fire has burnt rapidly for about an hourpush the hot coals and stone into the middle. Layer your wrapped meals or covered skillets in addition to the stones and coals and place on top. Following a few hours, you'll have some tasty camp food to relish.


<i>We hope you got insight from reading it, now let's go back to cold mango smoothie recipe. You can cook cold mango smoothie using <strong>3</strong> ingredients and <strong>3</strong> steps. Here is how you achieve it.
</i>

##### The ingredients needed to make Cold Mango Smoothie:

1. Use 1 teaspoon sugar
1. Get 1 Mango
1. Get 1/2 cup milk


##### Instructions to make Cold Mango Smoothie:

1. Cut mangos to bite size and freeze for 2 hours.
1. Put mangoes, milk and sugar in blender and purée. You can top with mangoes if you like.
1. Serve immediately.


You can cube the mango or use a glass to remove the mango from the skin (so easy). If you use fresh mango then make sure you&#39;re using a frozen banana in the recipe to keep the smoothie nice and thick and cold. But if fresh mangoes aren&#39;t available or in season, then absolutely use frozen mango. It&#39;s icy cold, and not too sweet, but very refreshing. All that yogurt is cool and tangy, and a good ripe mango provides all the sweetness you need.
