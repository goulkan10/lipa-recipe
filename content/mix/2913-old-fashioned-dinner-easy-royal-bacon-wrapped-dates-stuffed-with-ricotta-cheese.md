Getting A Healthy Eater

    
Camp cooking can be as elaborate or simple as you would like it to be. If you wish to prepare quick and simple but healthy meals as you are camping, camp cooking does not even need to need a fire. But if you're considering fueling your camping excursion using a feast, camp cooking can allow you to make hot, healthy foods that are as good as you can make them at home in your kitchen.

 Almost any cooking process you are using from the kitchen could be replicated around the campfire. For example, use a dutch oven or pit cooking to consume your meals. You might also easily fry foods at a bowl over a grill, or boil, braise and roast. Which sort of camping cookware is ideal for you? Camp cooking and cleanup may be easy or a hassle, but it all starts with great camping gear.

Some pots/pans come in sets that partner jointly or"nest" for storage and even allow you to tuck a canister of fuel inside them. This comes in handy once you're looking to save space whilst camping.

Following are some camping items to carry with you if you are considering preparing some meals around the campfire. These common kitchen items will allow you to duplicate tasty meals as you're out of doors.

• Salt and pepper
• Other of your favourite herbs and spices
• Cooking oil
• Pot holder
• Hand-held can opener
• Aluminum foil

• Cutting knives
• Cutting board
• Mixing bowl
• Paper or plastic silverware, plates and cups

In case you have only a couple of campers and are looking for some easy camp cooking, try out the easy and fast technique of tin can cooking. All you'll need is a fresh tin can -- a one gallon size can works well. Your source of warmth may be little campfire, or if wood burning is prohibited, a small buddy burner will work well, which can be found at sporting good stores or online. Put your meal in the tin can and simply heat the contents of your can over a flame.  This technique works great for sauces, beans and tuna fish.

A more time-consuming pub cooking technique that also produces yummy food is pit cooking.  It is also a great camp cooking system if you're using a dutch oven or cast iron cookware. Pit cooking warms your food by heating rocks and coals that are buried in the floor. As the rocks cool away, their emitted heat cooks the food. To pit cookfirst dig a hole that's roughly three times larger than your cookware. Line the pit with rocks and construct a fire in the middle. When the flame has burned rapidly for about one hourpush the hot coals and rocks into the middle. Layer your wrapped meals covered skillets in addition to the rocks and coals and put on top. Following a couple of hours, you'll have some tasty camp food to relish.
