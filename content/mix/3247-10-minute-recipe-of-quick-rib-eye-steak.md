Highly marbled rib-eye steak gets its distinctive beef flavor from the large swath of fat separating the longissimus from the spinalis dorsi. Rib-eye is one of the richest cuts available. The central eye of meat tends to be smooth-textured, with a finer grain than a strip steak. The spinalis dorsi section typically has a looser grain and more fat; this tiny crescent of tender meat is so rich. For something totally different, test your skills with Paul Ainsworth&#39;s Polenta, rib-eye steak, three artichokes and smoked yolks dish, and if you have a sous vide machine then definitely try Luke Holder&#39;s Sous vide rib-eye steak cooked in CafÃ© de Paris butter.
