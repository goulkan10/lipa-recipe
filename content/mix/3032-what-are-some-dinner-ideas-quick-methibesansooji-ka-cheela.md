This means that there will not be mountains of meals to be hand cleaned or loaded to the dishwasher (or if you are like me-both) afterwards. It's possible to spend less time cleaning just as you spent time slaving over a hot stove. Oh wait! Make that no time slaving over a hot stove. Once tidy is complete you can get back to enjoying the sun set, pursuing the lightening bugs with your little ones, or waiting for your first celebrity.
