So, how can crock pot cooking really help overcome the heat? Simply put, that the crock pot in and of itself puts off far less heat when cooking compared to an oven or stove top.

This usually means that there won't be mountains of dishes to be either hand washed or loaded to the dishwasher (or if you are like me-both) afterwards. You're able to spend less time cleaning only as you spent less time slaving over a hot cooker. Oh wait! Ensure no time slaving over a hot cooker. After tidy is complete you can contact enjoying the sun set, pursuing the lightening bugs along with your little ones, or even waiting for your first celebrity.

While there will be no one size fits all best cooking system, crock pot cooking comes really close. In case you've got a crock pot gathering dust somewhere in the back of your pantry it's the right time to get out it, dust off, and dig some great summer crock pot cooking recipes.
