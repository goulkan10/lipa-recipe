<i>Before you jump to Vietnamese Coffee (Cold brew with condensed milk) recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about {<strong>The Basics of Being Healthy</strong>.</i>
Becoming A Healthy Eater

It is possible for people to make healthy food choices even when they just have a short period to prepare their meals. The first point to understand is that it is often that healthy alternatives do not always mean a need for ab foods. Someone can select healthy foods that are quick and simple to prepare at home or even to pickup from a takeout area. Cities frequently provide restaurant guides in their telephone books that exhibit full-page menus suggesting what a specific restaurant or drive-thru offers. A number of these food vendors now include healthy alternatives to their typical fast-food selection.

 It has motivated the restaurants to present other options in their burger choices. Hamburgers can be ordered with no bun, for instance, and fruit and yogurt are included on the menu together with fresh cakes. Many restaurants provide salad options either as side orders or as total meals. Many times, a salad of fresh vegetables with chopped ham, roast beef or poultry is much more appealing than normal menu items.  Salads are especially appealing in the summertime since they're lighter on the digestive tract.

Restaurants that feature foods in season cultivated by local farmers offer quite healthy and affordable options.  This gives the consumer with a totally fresh selection and encourages them to visit the restaurant again.

If house preparation of meals is preferred, the alternatives for healthy decisions improve. Visiting a local grocery store or supermarket emphasizes the number of healthy choices that are available.  All types of cuisine can be prepared quickly because of the options of fresh goods rather than frozen foods. There are many options among frozen foods also. The demand for healthy frozen dinners and other meals has increased along with demands for much more variety in food that is frozen supplies. Any frozen food aisle at almost any supermarket will show as several healthy food options and bad choices. The decision is up to the person.

People can either choose to consume a healthy diet plan program or an unhealthy one. Time and access to healthy alternatives are no longer problems for someone who is attempting to eat better and healthier foods.

##### The ingredients needed to cook Vietnamese Coffee (Cold brew with condensed milk):

1. Get  Cold brew
1. Use 100 g coffee beans or 1 cup course ground coffee
1. Use 4 cups tap water
1. Provide  Coffee filter
1. Provide  Vietnamese coffee
1. Prepare 1 cup cold brew
1. Use 2-3 tbsp condensed milk
1. Provide  Ice


##### Steps to make Vietnamese Coffee (Cold brew with condensed milk):

1. Cold brew: I used the Woolworths special blend that is available from the baristas in store. They can grind it for you. Just make sure to tell them it needs to be a course grind
1. Grind coffee beans into a course ground (if not already)
1. Add water to coffee beans. This is a 1:4 ratio of ground coffee to water. This was the perfect strength for me.
1. For a stronger brew reduce the water to 3 cups (Pictured is a 1:2 ratio which I felt was going to be too strong for me)
1. Let infuse for 20 - 24 hours
1. Strain through a coffee filter
1. Refrigerate
1. Vietnamese coffee: Add condensed milk and ice to glass. Top with cold brew
1. Stir and enjoy


This will allow the beans to swell up and slow down the drip, making a stronger and more flavourful brew. The cold brew should last in your fridge for a week. Make the Vietnamese iced coffee: In a highball sized glass, add sweetened condense milk until the bottom is coated. Now add a little bit more. Vietnamese iced coffee is a drink containing a highly concentrated coffee (brewed with a Phin) combined with sweetened condensed milk and served over ice.
