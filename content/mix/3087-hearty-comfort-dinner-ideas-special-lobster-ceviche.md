<i>Before you jump to Lobster Ceviche recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about {<strong>The Simple Ways to Be Healthy</strong>.</i>
Becoming A Healthy Eater

    
Camp cooking can be as complicated or simple as you would like it to be. If you wish to prepare quick and easy but healthy meals as you are camping, camp cooking does not even have to need a flame. But if you're considering fueling your camping trip using a feast, then camp cooking can allow you to earn warm, healthy foods that are as good as you can create them at home in your kitchen.

Camp cooking doesn't have to be limited to sandwiches and baked potatoes wrapped in aluminum foil.  Just about any cooking system you use from the kitchen can be duplicated around the home. For instance, use a toaster or pit cooking to bake your meals. You could also easily fry foods at a pan over a grill, or boil, braise and roast. What sort of camping cookware is ideal for you? Camp cooking and cleanup may be easy or a hassle, and it all starts with great camping equipment.

Some pots/pans arrive in places that mate collectively or"nest" for storage and even allow you to tuck a spoonful of gas within them. This really comes in handy when you're wanting to save space whilst camping.

Following are some camping things to carry with you if you are thinking about preparing some meals around the campfire. These frequent kitchen items will allow you to duplicate tasty meals when you're out of doors.

• Salt and pepper
• Other of your favorite herbs and spices
• Cooking oil
• Pot holder

• Aluminum foil
• Tongs and spatula
• Cutting knives
• Cutting board
• Mixing bowl


In case you have only a couple campers and are searching for some easy camp cooking, try out the easy and quick technique of tin may cooking. All you'll need is a clean tin can -- a one gallon size can works nicely. Your source of heat can be a small campfire, or if wood burning is prohibited, a little buddy burner will work well, which may be seen at sporting good stores or online. Place your meal in the tin could and simply heat the contents of your can over a flame. You will have a hot meal ready in seconds.  This technique works great for sauces, beans and tuna fish.

A more time-consuming camp cooking technique which also produces tasty meals is pit cooking.  It's also a great camp cooking method if you're using a dutch oven or cast iron cookware. Pit cooking warms your food by heating rocks and coals which are buried in the ground. As the rocks cool away, their emitted heat cooks the food. To pit cook, first dig a hole that's approximately three times larger than your own cookware. Line the pit with rocks and create a fire in the middle. Once the flame has burned rapidly for about one hour, push the hot coals and stones into the middle. Twist your wrapped food covered skillets on top of the rocks and coals and place on top. Following a few hours, you will have some delicious camp food to relish.
