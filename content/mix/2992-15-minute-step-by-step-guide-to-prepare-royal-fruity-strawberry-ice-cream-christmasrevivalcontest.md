<i>Before you jump to Fruity strawberry ice cream #christmasrevivalcontest recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about {<strong>The Basics of Being Healthy</strong>.</i>
Becoming A Healthy Eater

    
Camp cooking can be as complicated or simple as you want it to be. If you wish to prepare quick and easy but healthy meals while you're camping, camp cooking doesn't even need to require a flame. However, if you are considering fueling your camping excursion using a feast, then camp cooking can enable you to earn warm, healthy foods which are as great as you can make them at home in your kitchen.

Camp cooking does not need to be limited to sandwiches and baked potatoes wrapped in aluminum foil.  Almost any cooking method you use in the kitchen can be replicated around the campfire. For instance, use a toaster or pit cooking to bake your meals. You could also easily bake foods at a bowl over a grill, or boil, braise and roast. Which kind of camping cookware is best for you? Camp cooking and clean-up may be easy or a hassle, and it all starts with great camping gear.

Some pots/pans arrive in places that partner jointly or"nest" for storage and also let you tuck a spoonful of fuel inside them. This really comes in handy when you're wanting to save space while camping.

Listed below are some camping items to carry with you if you're thinking about preparing some meals around the campfire. These common kitchen items will allow you to replicate yummy meals when you're out of doors.

â€¢ Salt and pepper
â€¢ Other your favorite herbs and spices
â€¢ Cooking oil
â€¢ Pot holder
â€¢ Hand-held can opener
â€¢ Aluminum foil
â€¢ Tongs and spatula
â€¢ Cutting knives
â€¢ Cutting board
â€¢ Mixing bowl
â€¢ Paper or plastic silverware, plates and cups

In case you have just a few campers and are searching for some very easy camp cooking, try out the easy and quick technique of tin may cooking. All you will need is a clean tin can -- a one gallon size may works well. Your source of heat can be a small campfire, or if wood burning is prohibited, a little buddy burner may work well, which can be seen at sporting good stores or online. Place your meal in the tin can and simply warm the contents of your can over a fire.  This technique works great for sauces, beans and poultry.

A more time-consuming pub cooking technique which also produces yummy food is pit cooking.  It is also a great camp cooking system if you are using a dutch oven or cast iron cookware. Pit cooking warms your food by heating rocks and coals which are buried in the floor. As the rocks cool off, their emitted heat cooks the meals. To pit cookfirst dig a hole that's roughly three times bigger than your own cookware. Line the pit with stones and build a fire in the center. When the flame has burnt rapidly for approximately an hourpush the warm coals and stones into the center. Layer your wrapped food or covered skillets on top of the rocks and coals and place more on top. Following a few hours, you'll have some tasty camp food to enjoy.

The higher fat content used, the richer the end product will taste. Gelato has a more silky texture and is usually denser than ice cream. A wide variety of strawberry ice cream options are available to you, such as chocolate, fruity, and original. When the ice cream is the consistency of whipped cream, stir in the berries.
