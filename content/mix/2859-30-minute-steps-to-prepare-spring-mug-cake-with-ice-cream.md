On day four of the heat wave, I decided to mix things up a bit and make a mug cake…with ice cream. Lordy was that the best idea ever. I was dreaming of chocolate cake but the idea of turning on the oven was frightening…the house was hot enough already. The mug cake came out great, though it had more of a bread texture rather than a cake. Not that there is anything wrong with that.
