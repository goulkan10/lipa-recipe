Becoming A Healthy Eater

    
Camp cooking can be as elaborate or simple as you want it to be. If you wish to prepare quick and easy but healthy meals when you're camping, camp cooking does not even need to require a fire. But if you're thinking about ridding your camping excursion using a feast, camp cooking can allow you to earn warm, healthy foods which are as great as you can create them at home in your own kitchen.

Camp cooking does not need to be limited to sandwiches and baked potatoes wrapped in aluminum foil.  Just about any cooking process you are using from the kitchen could be duplicated around the campfire. For instance, use a toaster or pit cooking to bake your food. You could also easily bake foods in a pan over a grill, or boil, braise and roast. Which kind of camping cookware is best for you? Camp cooking and cleanup can be easy or a hassle, and it all starts with great camping gear.

Some pots/pans arrive in places that mate collectively or"nest" for storage and even allow you to tuck a canister of fuel inside them. This really also comes in handy when you're seeking to save space whilst camping.

Listed below are some camping items to consider with you if you are planning on preparing some meals around the home. These common kitchen items will allow you to duplicate tasty meals when you are out of doors.

• Salt and pepper
• Other your favorite herbs and spices
• Cooking oil
• Pot holder

• Aluminum foil

• Cutting knives
• Cutting board
• Mixing bowl
• Paper or plastic silverware, plates and cups

If you have only a couple of campers and are searching for some easy camp cooking, try out the simple and fast technique of tin may cooking. All you will need is a fresh tin can -- a 1 gallon size may works nicely. Your source of warmth can be a small campfire, or if wood burning is illegal, a small buddy burner will work nicely, which can be found at sporting good stores or online. Place your meal from the tin can and simply heat the contents of your can over a flame.  This technique works great for sauces, beans and tuna fish.

A more time-consuming pub cooking technique which also produces yummy food is pit cooking.  It is also a great camp cooking method if you are using a dutch oven or cast iron cookware. Pit cooking calms your food by heating rocks and coals that are buried in the floor. As the rocks cool off, their emitted heat cooks the meals. To pit cookfirst dig a hole that's roughly three times bigger than your own cookware. Line the pit with stones and create a fire in the center. Once the fire has burnt rapidly for approximately one hour, push the warm coals and rocks into the center. Twist your wrapped meals covered skillets on top of the stones and coals and place on top. Following a couple of hours, you will have some delicious camp food to relish.

It can be prepared in a jiffy with very few ingredients. The only thing about this dosa is, it should be eaten hot as it does not taste good when cold. I love dosas especially instant dosa as it comes handy when we do not have. This besan chilla recipe also called Rajasthani besan cheela is a tasty Indian pancake made of besan (gram flour), spices and herbs. Chilla or Cheela are popular Indian crepes.
