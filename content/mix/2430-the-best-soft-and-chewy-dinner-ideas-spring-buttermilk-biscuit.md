<i>Before you jump to Buttermilk Biscuit recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about {<strong>The Basics of Being Healthy</strong>.</i>
Getting A Healthy Eater

Whether your traveling on the go or round the
Home, you don't have to provide up healthy eating
Simply because you are on the run. The fact is,
Healthy eating is much more significant when your
Trying to keep up with a busy schedule.


Worry better. As you hustle around, a healthy meal
Is most likely the very last thing you consider. The
Following ideas can help you eat if your on the go.

Restaurants
With tempting menus, big portions, and a festive
Air, it's easy to bypass healthy eating. It's
Okay to splurge every now and then, although you'll
Pack on a great deal of weight should you make it a habit.
When you eat out at restaurants, consistently be smart
about it.

Airports
An airport may be a very stressful place, though 
You shouldn't squander your diet for this. Eat
Since you're hungry, not because of stress,
Boredom, or to kill time.

In your Vehicle 

So that if you become hungry - you have them.

At home
Evenings and mornings are busy intervals in many houses.
Making the time to eat can be difficult, although you
Should not run outside the door without even eating breakfast
first. 
A bagel is a superb way to start the day.

Anytime you are on the go, always Be Certain That you
Make the perfect food choices. You can take healthy
Food with you in the event you need to, so that you have it
When you want it. Eating healthy on the go is simple 
To do, as soon as you know how. Never sacrifice healthy
Food for crap, as your system will regret it afterwards.

##### Steps to make Buttermilk Biscuit:

1. Mix lemon juice with milk. Stir and let it sit for 5 - 10 minutes in the refrigerator. This mixture is the buttermilk.

Be sure to use a light touch because overmixing will toughen the biscuits dough. Use a pastry cutter to incorporate butter or lard into the mixture until crumbly. These Classic Southern Buttermilk Biscuits are light, tender, and the perfect match for a slice of ham, melted butter and honey, your favorite jam, or smothered in country gravy! Buttermilk biscuits are my absolute favorite thing to bake. They emerge from the oven all buttery and flaky, begging to be spread with jam (or made into epic fried chicken sandwiches).
