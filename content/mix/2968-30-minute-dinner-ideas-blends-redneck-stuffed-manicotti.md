Becoming A Healthy Eater

    
Camp cooking can be as elaborate or simple as you would like it to be. If you want to prepare fast and simple but nutritious meals when you are swimming, camp cooking does not even have to require a flame. However, if you're interested in fueling your camping trip with a feast, camp cooking can make it possible for you to make warm, healthy foods which are as great as you can create them at home in your own kitchen.

 Just about any cooking method you use from the kitchen can be replicated around the home. For example, use a dutch oven or pit cooking to bake your food. You might also easily fry foods at a pan over a grill, or boil, braise and roast. What type of camping cookware is best for you? Camp cooking and clean-up can be easy or a hassle, and it all starts with great camping gear.

Some pots/pans arrive in places that mate together or"nest" for storage and even let you tuck a canister of fuel inside them. This really also comes in handy once you're wanting to save space while camping.

Following are some camping things to consider with you if you're considering preparing some meals around the campfire. These common kitchen items allow you to replicate yummy meals while you are out of doorways.


• Other of your favorite herbs and spices
• Cooking oil
• Pot holder

• Aluminum foil

• Cutting knives
• Cutting board
• Mixing bowl
• Paper or plastic silverware, plates and cups

In case you have just a couple of campers and are searching for some simple camp cooking, try the easy and fast technique of tin can cooking. All you will need is a clean tin can -- a 1 gallon size may works well. Your source of warmth may be small campfire, or if wood burning is prohibited, a small buddy burner may work nicely, which can be located at sporting good stores or online. Place your meal in the tin could and simply heat the contents of your can over a flame.  This technique works great for sauces, beans and tuna fish.

A more time-consuming pub cooking technique that also produces tasty food is pit cooking.  It's also a great camp cooking method if you're using a dutch oven or cast iron cookware. Pit cooking warms your food by heating stones and coals that are buried in the floor. As the rocks cool away, their emitted heat cooks the food. To pit cookfirst dig a hole that is approximately three times larger than your cookware. Line the pit with stones and build a fire in the center. Once the fire has burnt rapidly for approximately an hourpush the warm coals and stone into the middle. Twist your wrapped meals covered skillets on top of the rocks and coals and put on top. After a couple of hours, you will have some tasty camp food to relish.
