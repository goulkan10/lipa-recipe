I have been in the mood for pork chops lately and we had some nice Vermont maple syrup in the fridge so I tried out this recipe. After reading the comments about the lack of flavor I decided to kick up the flavor of the marinade by browning the onions in the hot pan after the pork was seared adding a few shakes of red pepper paprika and subbing out the white vinegar with apple cider vinegar. Sticky sweet chops with a fiery black pepper kick. This recipe is super easy to whip up, and these barbecue pork chops are perfect during the busy week. For this recipe I used bone in pork chops, that is my preference.
