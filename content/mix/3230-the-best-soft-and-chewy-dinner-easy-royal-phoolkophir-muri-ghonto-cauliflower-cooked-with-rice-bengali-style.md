<i>Before you jump to Phoolkophir Muri Ghonto (Cauliflower cooked with Rice - Bengali style) recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about {<strong>The Simple Ways to Be Healthy</strong>.</i>
Becoming A Healthy Eater

    
Camp cooking can be as elaborate or simple as you would like it to be. If you wish to prepare fast and easy but healthy meals when you are camping, camp cooking doesn't even need to require a fire. However, if you are thinking about fueling your camping excursion using a feast, then camp cooking can enable you to make warm, healthy foods that are as great as you can make them at home in your own kitchen.

 Just about any cooking system you use from the kitchen can be replicated around the home. For instance, use a dutch oven or pit cooking to bake your meals. You can also easily fry foods at a pan over a grill, or boil, braise and roast. Which type of camping cookware is ideal for you? Camp cooking and cleanup can be easy or a hassle, and it all starts with great camping equipment.

Some pots/pans arrive in places that mate together or"nest" for storage and also let you tuck a canister of gas within them. This comes in handy once you're wanting to save space while camping.

Listed below are some camping things to take with you if you are planning on preparing some meals around the home. These common kitchen items will allow you to replicate yummy meals while you are out of doorways.

• Salt and pepper
• Other your favourite herbs and spices
• Cooking oil
• Pot holder

• Aluminum foil

• Cutting knives
• Cutting board
• Mixing bowl


If you have only a couple campers and are looking for some very easy camp cooking, try the simple and quick technique of tin can cooking. All you'll need is a clean tin can -- a 1 gallon size can works nicely. Your source of heat can be a little campfire, or if wood burning is prohibited, a small buddy burner will work nicely, which can be found at sporting good stores or online. Put your meal in the tin can and simply heat the contents of your own can over a flame.  This technique works great for soups, beans and tuna fish.

A more time-consuming pub cooking technique that also produces yummy meals is pit cooking. Pit cooking is good for items that may be wrapped in aluminum foil to be cooked.  It's also a wonderful camp cooking system if you are using a dutch oven or cast iron cookware. Pit cooking warms your food by heating rocks and coals that are buried in the ground. As the rocks cool , their emitted heat cooks the food. To pit cook, first dig a hole that's about three times larger than your own cookware. Line the pit with rocks and create a fire in the center. Once the flame has burned rapidly for about one hourpush the hot coals and stone into the center. Twist your wrapped meals covered skillets in addition to the rocks and coals and put on top. After a couple of hours, you will have some tasty camp food to enjoy.

Muri Ghonto is one of the most popular and traditional Bengali recipes that is prepared using the head portion of fish and rice. I personally do not like fish but my husband is a true bong and simply can&#39;t live without it. It is only because of him that I cook fish at home and fortunately he loves them. Muri Ghonto is an amazing traditional Bengali recipe. This Indian fish recipe is famous in Bengal and one of their best delicacies.
