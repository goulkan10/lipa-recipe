<i>Before you jump to Marshmallow strawberry ice cream recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about {<strong>The Basics of Being Healthy</strong>.</i>
Getting A Healthy Eater

    
Camp cooking can be as complicated or simple as you want it to be. If you would like to prepare fast and simple but healthy meals as you're swimming, camp cooking does not even need to require a fire. However, if you are interested in ridding your camping trip with a feast, camp cooking can allow you to make warm, healthy foods that are as great as you can make them at home in your own kitchen.

Camp cooking does not need to be limited to sandwiches and baked potatoes wrapped in aluminum foil.  Almost any cooking process you use in the kitchen can be replicated around the campfire. For instance, use a toaster or pit cooking to bake your meals. You could also easily fry foods at a bowl over a grill, or boil, braise and beverage. Which kind of camping cookware is best for you? Camp cooking and cleanup can be easy or a hassle, it all starts with great camping equipment.

Some pots/pans come in sets that partner together or"nest" for storage and even allow you to tuck a canister of gas within them. This really comes in handy once you're trying to save room whilst camping.

Following are some camping things to carry with you if you're considering preparing some meals around the home. These common kitchen items allow you to replicate yummy meals while you're out of doorways.


• Other of your favorite herbs and spices
• Cooking oil
• Pot holder

• Aluminum foil

• Cutting knives
• Cutting board
• Mixing bowl


If you have only a couple campers and are searching for some very simple camp cooking, try the easy and fast technique of tin can cooking. All you'll need is a fresh tin can -- a 1 gallon size can works well. Your source of warmth may be small campfire, or when wood burning is illegal, a small buddy burner will work nicely, which can be located at sporting good stores or online. Put your meal in the tin can and simply warm the contents of your can over a fire.  This technique works great for sauces, beans and tuna fish.

A more time-consuming camp cooking technique that also produces yummy food is pit cooking. Pit cooking is excellent for items that may be wrapped in aluminum foil to be cooked.  It is also a excellent camp cooking system if you're using a dutch oven or cast iron cookware. Pit cooking warms your food by heating stones and coals that are buried in the ground. As the rocks cool away, their emitted heat cooks the meals. To pit cookfirst dig a hole that is about three times larger than your own cookware. Line the pit with rocks and build a fire in the center. When the fire has burnt rapidly for about one hourpush the warm coals and stones into the middle. Layer your wrapped meals covered skillets on top of the rocks and coals and put more on top. After a couple of hours, you will have some tasty camp food to enjoy.

Take some ice cream cones and. Ice Cream has a custard base of milk/cream, sugar, and usually egg yolks. The higher fat content used, the richer the end product will taste. Gelato is churned slower than ice cream and usually has a lower proportion of cream and eggs, sometimes none at all. If all cheesecakes were marshmallow cheesecakes, the world would be a better place.
