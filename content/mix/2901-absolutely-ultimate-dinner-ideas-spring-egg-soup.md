Getting A Healthy Eater


After the weather warms warms up, the kitchen can be a horrible place to be. There are numerous things that you can do yet, when it comes to cooking a wonderful home made meal which does not require traditional stove top or oven cooking. Learn how to utilize some of those lesser heat producing equipment in your own kitchen, like the crock pot, to be able to truly beat the summer heat and keep your cool when preparing a great warm meal for friends and loved ones.

So, how does crock pot cooking really help beat the heat? In other words, the crock pot in and of itself puts off far less heat compared to cooking than the oven or stove . Here is the very first and possibly the best reason to use the crock pot on your summer meal preparation. You should also think about the fact that by not heating the house by using your stove or oven you're also preventing your air conditioning (or additional heating systems ) from working overtime so as to compensate for the extra heat which other cooking systems pose.

This makes crock pot cooking a win-win scenario as the costs involved in managing a crock pot are far less than the costs involved in managing a stove or oven generally. Whether electric or gas, your stove and oven tend to be considerable energy hogs. Add to that the fact that you are not increasing the temperature in your home by conventional means of cooking and you are using less power.

Unfortunately for many, the general consensus has been that crock pots were intended for comfort foods and hearty winter foods.  The reality is that the crock pot should be one of your best loved and most often utilized cooking methods if you can manage it.  

Benefits of Crock Pot Cooking

Along with the cost benefits cited above when it comes to crock pot cooking there are quite a few different benefits that are well worth mentioning. First of all, the bulk of the work involved with crock pot cooking occurs early in the afternoon when you're refreshed instead of at the end of a frantic work or perform day. This means that you're not as inclined to forget an ingredient or make other mistakes that often happen as we hurriedly prepare a dinner once we are tired from the actions of our day.

Secondly, many good crock pot recipes include the vegetables that insure we're getting the nutrients we need. So often, when planning a meal at the last moment, vegetables and other side dishes are left out in favor of expedience. Crock pot cooking in many instances is really a meal in 1 dish.

 Unlike vegetables and pans, many crock pot dishes are created in one dish. This usually means that there is not going to be mountains of meals to be hand washed or loaded to the dishwasher (or if you're like me-both) afterwards. You can spend less time cleaning just as you spent less time slaving over a hot stove. Oh wait! Ensure no time slaving over a hot cooker. Once clean up is complete you can get back to enjoying the sun set, chasing the lightening bugs with your small ones, or even waiting for the very first celebrity.

While there'll never be a 1 size fits all best cooking system, crock pot cooking comes very close. When you have a crock pot gathering dust somewhere at the back of your pantry it is time to get out it, dust off, and dig up some excellent summer crock pot cooking recipes.
