 Almost any cooking method you use in the kitchen could be replicated around the campfire. For instance, use a toaster or pit cooking to bake your food. You might also easily fry foods in a pan over a grill, or boil, braise and beverage. Which kind of camping cookware is ideal for you?

If you have only a few campers and are searching for some very easy camp cooking, try the easy and speedy technique of tin could cooking. All you will need is a clean tin can -- a 1 gallon size can works nicely. Your source of warmth may be small campfire, or when wood burning is illegal, a small buddy burner may work well, which may be found at sporting good stores or online.

Pit cooking calms your food by heating rocks and coals which are buried in the ground. As the rocks cool off, their emitted heat cooks the meals. To pit cook, first dig a hole that's approximately three times bigger than your cookware. Line the pit with stones and create a fire in the center. Once the fire has burned rapidly for about one hourpush the warm coals and rocks into the center. Twist your wrapped meals or covered skillets in addition to the stones and coals and place on top. Following a couple of hours, you'll have some tasty camp food to relish.
