Becoming A Healthy Eater

    
Camp cooking can be as complicated or simple as you would like it to be. If you wish to prepare quick and simple but healthy meals when you're camping, camp cooking doesn't even have to need a fire. However, if you're thinking about ridding your camping trip having a feast, then camp cooking can allow you to earn hot, healthy foods that are as good as you can create them at home in your own kitchen.

Camp cooking does not have to be limited to sandwiches and baked potatoes wrapped in aluminum foil.  Almost any cooking system you are using in the kitchen could be duplicated around the campfire. For example, use a toaster or pit cooking to consume your food. You can also easily bake foods in a bowl over a grill, or boil, braise and roast. Which sort of camping cookware is best for you? Camp cooking and clean-up can be easy or a hassle, it all starts with great camping equipment.

Some pots/pans come in sets that partner together or"nest" for storage and also allow you to tuck a spoonful of gas within them. This also comes in handy when you're searching to save room whilst camping.

Following are some camping items to take with you if you are considering preparing some meals around the home. These frequent kitchen items will allow you to replicate yummy meals while you are out of doors.


• Other of your favorite herbs and spices
• Cooking oil
• Pot holder

• Aluminum foil

• Cutting knives
• Cutting board
• Mixing bowl


If you have just a couple campers and are looking for some easy camp cooking, try the simple and speedy technique of tin can cooking. All you will need is a clean tin can -- a 1 gallon size may works well. Your source of heat can be a little campfire, or when wood burning is illegal, a little buddy burner will work nicely, which may be found at sporting good stores or online. Place your meal from the tin could and simply warm the contents of your can over a flame.  This technique works great for sauces, beans and poultry.

A more time-consuming pub cooking technique which also produces delectable meals is pit cooking.  It's also a wonderful camp cooking method if you are using a dutch oven or cast iron cookware. Pit cooking warms your meals by heating stones and coals which are concealed in the ground. As the stones cool away, their emitted heat cooks the meals. To pit cook, first dig a hole that is approximately three times bigger than your cookware. Line the pit with stones and construct a fire in the center. When the fire has burned rapidly for about one hour, push the warm coals and rocks into the middle. Twist your wrapped food covered skillets on top of the stones and coals and place more on top. After a few hours, you'll have some tasty camp food to relish.

Greek yogurt instead of plain is a must, if there&#39;s any liquid in the yogurt be sure to drain it. I tested with Fage and Stonyfield Greek, both worked great. Amazing vegan and gluten-free French toast! Made with almond milk, pureed banana, and chia seeds. Serve with easy caramelized bananas and maple syrup!
