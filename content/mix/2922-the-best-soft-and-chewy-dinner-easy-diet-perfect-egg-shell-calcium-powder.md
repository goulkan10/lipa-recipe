Getting A Healthy Eater

    
Camp cooking can be as complicated or simple as you want it to be. If you wish to prepare quick and simple but healthy meals when you are swimming, camp cooking doesn't even need to need a fire. But if you're interested in fueling your camping trip using a feast, then camp cooking can enable you to earn hot, healthy foods that are as great as you can create them at home in your own kitchen.

Camp cooking does not have to be limited to sandwiches and baked potatoes wrapped in aluminum foil.  Almost any cooking system you use in the kitchen can be replicated around the home. For instance, use a dutch oven or pit cooking to bake your food. You might also easily bake foods in a bowl over a grill, or boil, braise and beverage. What kind of camping cookware is ideal for you? Camp cooking and cleanup can be easy or a hassle, it all starts with great camping equipment.

Some pots/pans come in places that mate jointly or"nest" for storage and even let you tuck a canister of gas within them. This also comes in handy when you're looking to save room while camping.

Following are some camping items to take with you if you are planning on preparing some meals around the home. These frequent kitchen items will allow you to duplicate tasty meals when you're out of doorways.


• Other of your favorite herbs and spices
• Cooking oil
• Pot holder

• Aluminum foil
• Tongs and spatula
• Cutting knives
• Cutting board
• Mixing bowl
• Paper or plastic silverware, plates and cups

If you have only a couple of campers and are searching for some easy camp cooking, try out the easy and fast technique of tin can cooking. All you will need is a clean tin can -- a one gallon size can works nicely. Your source of warmth can be a little campfire, or if wood burning is illegal, a little buddy burner will work well, which can be located at sporting good stores or online. Place your meal from the tin can and easily heat the contents of your can over a flame. You will have a hot meal ready in seconds.  This technique works great for sauces, beans and tuna fish.

A more time-consuming pub cooking technique that also produces tasty meals is pit cooking. Pit cooking is excellent for items that may be wrapped in aluminum foil to be cooked.  It's also a great camp cooking system if you are using a dutch oven or cast iron cookware. Pit cooking warms your meals by heating stones and coals that are buried in the floor. As the rocks cool , their emitted heat cooks the food. To pit cook, first dig a hole that's about three times bigger than your own cookware. Line the pit with stones and construct a fire in the center. Once the flame has burnt rapidly for about an hourpush the warm coals and stones into the center. Twist your wrapped food or covered skillets in addition to the stones and coals and put on top. Following a few hours, you'll have some tasty camp food to relish.
