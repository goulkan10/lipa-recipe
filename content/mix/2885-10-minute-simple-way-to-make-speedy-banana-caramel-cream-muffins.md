Second, many good crock pot recipes include the vegetables that guarantee we're getting the nutrients we need. So often, when preparing a meal in the last minute, vegetables and other side dishes are made in favour of expedience. Crock pot cooking many instances is a meal in 1 dish.

One other wonderful reason to use a crock pot for the summer cooking is that the ease of clean up.  Unlike pots and pans, many crock pot meals are created in 1 dish. This means that there will not be mountains of meals to be either hand cleaned or loaded to the dishwasher (or in case you're like me-both) afterwards. It is possible to spend less time cleaning as you spent time slaving over a hot cooker. Oh wait! Ensure no time slaving over a hot cooker. After clean up is complete you can contact enjoying the sun set, chasing the lightening bugs with your little ones, or waiting for the very first superstar.

While there'll be no 1 size fits all very ideal cooking process, crock pot cooking comes really close. When you have a crock pot collecting dust somewhere in the back of your pantry it's time to get out it, dust in the offand dig up some wonderful summertime crock pot cooking recipes.
