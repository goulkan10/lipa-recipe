Here is the very first and possibly the very best reason to use the crock pot on summer time meal planning. You should also look at the fact that by not heating the house by using your stove top or oven you're also preventing your air conditioning (or alternative cooling methods) from working overtime so as to compensate for the extra heat that other cooking methods introduce.

This makes crock pot cooking a win-win situation as the costs involved in operating a crock marijuana are much less compared to the costs involved in operating a stove or oven generally.

So often, when planning a meal at the last moment, vegetables and other side dishes have been left out in favour of expedience. Crock pot cooking in many cases is really a meal in one dish.

 Unlike vegetables and pans, most crock pot meals are created in one dish. This usually means that there isn't going to be mountains of dishes to be hand washed or packed to the dishwasher (or in case you're like me-both) afterwards. It's possible to spend less time cleaning just as you spent less time slaving over a hot stove. Oh wait! Make that no time slaving over a hot cooker.
