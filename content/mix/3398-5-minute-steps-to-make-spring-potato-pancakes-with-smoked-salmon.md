Becoming A Healthy Eater

    
Camp cooking can be as complicated or simple as you would like it to be. If you want to prepare fast and simple but nutritious meals as you are swimming, camp cooking does not even need to need a fire. But if you are interested in fueling your camping trip using a feast, then camp cooking can allow you to make hot, healthy foods which are as good as you can make them at home in your kitchen.

 Almost any cooking process you are using in the kitchen can be duplicated around the campfire. For instance, use a dutch oven or pit cooking to bake your food. You may also easily fry foods in a bowl over a grill, or boil, braise and roast. Which kind of camping cookware is ideal for you? Camp cooking and cleanup may be easy or a hassle, it all starts with great camping equipment.

Some pots/pans arrive in places that mate together or"nest" for storage and also allow you to tuck a spoonful of gas within them. This really comes in handy once you're seeking to save space whilst camping.

Following are some camping items to take with you if you are thinking about preparing some meals around the campfire. These frequent kitchen items will allow you to duplicate tasty meals while you are out of doorways.

• Salt and pepper
• Other of your favourite herbs and spices
• Cooking oil
• Pot holder
• Hand-held can opener
• Aluminum foil

• Cutting knives
• Cutting board
• Mixing bowl
• Paper or plastic silverware, plates and cups

In case you have only a few campers and are searching for some easy camp cooking, try the simple and quick technique of tin may cooking. All you'll need is a clean tin can -- a one gallon size can works well. Your source of warmth can be a small campfire, or when wood burning is illegal, a little buddy burner will work nicely, which may be seen at sporting good stores or online. Put your meal in the tin can and simply heat the contents of your own can over a flame. You will have a hot meal ready in minutes.  This technique works great for soups, beans and poultry.

A more time-consuming camp cooking technique which also produces tasty food is pit cooking.  It is also a great camp cooking method if you are using a dutch oven or cast iron cookware. Pit cooking calms your meals by heating stones and coals that are buried in the ground. As the stones cool away, their emitted heat cooks the meals. To pit cook, first dig a hole that is about three times larger than your own cookware. Line the pit with rocks and create a fire in the middle. Once the flame has burned rapidly for approximately an hourpush the hot coals and rocks into the center. Twist your wrapped food covered skillets in addition to the rocks and coals and put more on top. After a few hours, you will have some delicious camp food to relish.

Ideal brunch recipe with potato pancakes and smoked salmon and caviar. Continue with the rest of the batter, adding more oil as necessary. Crispy potato pancakes topped with caramelized onions, smoked salmon and dill sour cream. I would serve two of these as a first course per person While onions are cooking, grate potatoes. Squeeze potatoes in paper towels to release as much liquid as possible.
