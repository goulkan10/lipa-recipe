Becoming A Healthy Eater

    
Camp cooking can be as elaborate or simple as you would like it to be. If you would like to prepare quick and easy but nutritious meals while you're camping, camp cooking does not even have to need a flame. But if you're considering fueling your camping trip with a feast, then camp cooking can enable you to make warm, healthy foods which are as great as you can create them at home in your kitchen.

Camp cooking does not need to be limited to sandwiches and baked potatoes wrapped in aluminum foil.  Just about any cooking process you are using in the kitchen could be replicated around the campfire. For example, use a dutch oven or pit cooking to consume your food. You might also easily fry foods at a bowl over a grill, or boil, braise and beverage. What kind of camping cookware is best for you? Camp cooking and cleanup may be easy or a hassle, and it all starts with great camping equipment.

Some pots/pans arrive in places that mate jointly or"nest" for storage and even allow you to tuck a canister of gas within them. This comes in handy when you're trying to save space while camping.

Following are some camping items to carry with you if you're thinking about preparing some meals around the home. These common kitchen items allow you to replicate yummy meals as you're out of doorways.


• Other of your favorite herbs and spices
• Cooking oil
• Pot holder
• Hand-held can opener
• Aluminum foil
• Tongs and spatula
• Cutting knives
• Cutting board
• Mixing bowl
• Paper or plastic silverware, plates and cups

When you have just a few campers and are searching for some simple camp cooking, try the easy and speedy technique of tin could cooking. All you'll need is a fresh tin can -- a 1 gallon size can works well. Your source of heat can be a small campfire, or when wood burning is prohibited, a little buddy burner will work nicely, which can be found at sporting good stores or online. Put your meal in the tin could and easily heat the contents of your can over a flame.  This technique works great for sauces, beans and tuna fish.

A more time-consuming camp cooking technique that also produces delectable meals is pit cooking.  It is also a excellent camp cooking system if you're using a dutch oven or cast iron cookware. Pit cooking warms your meals by heating stones and coals which are buried in the floor. As the rocks cool off, their emitted heat cooks the food. To pit cook, first dig a hole that's roughly three times larger than your cookware. Line the pit with rocks and build a fire in the center. When the flame has burned rapidly for approximately one hour, push the warm coals and rocks into the middle. Layer your wrapped meals or covered skillets on top of the rocks and coals and put on top. After a number of hours, you will have some delicious camp food to relish.
