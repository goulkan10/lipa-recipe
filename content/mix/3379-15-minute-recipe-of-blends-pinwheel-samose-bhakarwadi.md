Becoming A Healthy Eater

    
Camp cooking can be as complicated or simple as you want it to be. If you would like to prepare fast and simple but healthy meals as you're swimming, camp cooking does not even need to require a fire. But if you are considering ridding your camping trip having a feast, camp cooking can enable you to make hot, healthy foods that are as good as you can make them at home in your kitchen.

 Just about any cooking method you are using from the kitchen can be duplicated around the campfire. For example, use a dutch oven or pit cooking to bake your meals. You might also easily fry foods in a bowl over a grill, or boil, braise and beverage. Which type of camping cookware is best for you? Camp cooking and clean-up can be easy or a hassle, it all starts with great camping gear.

Some pots/pans arrive in sets that partner together or"nest" for storage and also let you tuck a spoonful of gas within them. This really comes in handy once you're looking to save space whilst camping.

Following are some camping items to carry with you if you are considering preparing some meals around the home. These frequent kitchen items will allow you to duplicate tasty meals when you are out of doors.

• Salt and pepper
• Other of your favourite herbs and spices
• Cooking oil
• Pot holder
• Hand-held can opener
• Aluminum foil

• Cutting knives
• Cutting board
• Mixing bowl
• Paper or plastic silverware, plates and cups

In case you have only a couple of campers and are looking for some very easy camp cooking, try out the simple and quick technique of tin can cooking. All you'll need is a clean tin can -- a one gallon size may works well. Your source of warmth can be a small campfire, or if wood burning is illegal, a little buddy burner will work nicely, which may be located at sporting good stores or online. Put your meal in the tin could and easily heat the contents of your can over a fire. You will have a hot meal ready in seconds.  This technique works great for sauces, beans and poultry.

A more time-consuming pub cooking technique which also produces tasty meals is pit cooking.  It's also a wonderful camp cooking system if you're using a dutch oven or cast iron cookware. Pit cooking warms your food by heating rocks and coals that are concealed in the ground. As the stones cool off, their emitted heat cooks the meals. To pit cook, first dig a hole that's about three times bigger than your own cookware. Line the pit with rocks and create a fire in the middle. Once the fire has burned rapidly for about an hour, push the warm coals and stones into the center. Twist your wrapped food or covered skillets on top of the rocks and coals and put on top. After a couple of hours, you'll have some delicious camp food to relish.
