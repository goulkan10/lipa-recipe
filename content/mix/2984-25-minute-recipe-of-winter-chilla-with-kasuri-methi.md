This means that there will not be mountains of dishes to be hand washed or packed to the dishwasher (or in case you're like me-both) later. You're able to spend less time cleaning just as you spent less time slaving over a hot stove. Oh wait! Make that no time slaving over a hot cooker. Once clean up is complete you can get back to enjoying the sun set, pursuing the lightening bugs with your little ones, or waiting for your very first celebrity.
