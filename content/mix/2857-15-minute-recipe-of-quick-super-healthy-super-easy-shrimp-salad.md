This is the first and maybe the best reason to use the crock pot on your summer meal preparation. You should also think about that by not heating your house by utilizing your stove or oven you're also preventing your air conditioning (or alternative cooling systems ) from working overtime so as to compensate for the additional heat which other cooking systems pose.

Secondly, many good crock pot recipes incorporate the vegetables that insure we're getting the nutrients that we need.

One other great reason to use a crock pot for your summer cooking is the ease of clean up.  Unlike vegetables and pans, most crock pot dishes are created in 1 dish. This usually means that there is not going to be mountains of dishes to be hand washed or loaded to the dishwasher (or if you're like me-both) afterwards. You can spend less time cleaning only as you spent less time slaving over a hot stove. Oh wait! Ensure time slaving over a hot cooker. After tidy is complete you can get back to enjoying the sunshine set, pursuing the lightening bugs along with your small ones, or waiting for your very first celebrity.

While there'll be no one size fits all ideal cooking procedure, crock pot cooking comes very near. If you have a crock pot gathering dust somewhere at the back of your pantry it's the right time to get it out, dust if off, and dig some fantastic summer crock pot cooking recipes.
