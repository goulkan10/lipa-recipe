The secret to making a meatloaf taste really good is to use fatty beef, plenty of flavourings and to grate your onion instead of dicing it. Most people who replace their ground beef with buffalo, in recipes like meatballs, burgers, and meatloaf, are usually disappointed. Ground buffalo is much leaner than ground beef, which is the biggest challenge. Granny&#39;s Classic Meatloaf is the ultimate easy-to-make dinner comfort food that your entire family will enjoy. It is the best easy meatloaf recipe you can make using ground beef and a tasty meatloaf sauce on top.
