<i>Before you jump to Methi Dane Laddu (Fenugreek seeds Laddu) recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about {<strong>The Basics of Being Healthy</strong>.</i>
Becoming A Healthy Eater

    
Camp cooking can be as elaborate or simple as you want it to be. If you want to prepare fast and simple but healthy meals when you are swimming, camp cooking doesn't even need to require a flame. However, if you're interested in ridding your camping excursion having a feast, then camp cooking can enable you to earn hot, healthy foods that are as great as you can create them at home in your own kitchen.

Camp cooking doesn't have to be limited to sandwiches and baked potatoes wrapped in aluminum foil.  Just about any cooking method you are using in the kitchen can be replicated around the campfire. For instance, use a dutch oven or pit cooking to consume your food. You could also easily bake foods at a pan over a grill, or boil, braise and beverage. What kind of camping cookware is ideal for you? Camp cooking and clean-up may be easy or a hassle, and it all starts with great camping equipment.

Some pots/pans arrive in sets that partner together or"nest" for storage and even allow you to tuck a canister of fuel inside them. This also comes in handy once you're searching to save room while camping.

Listed below are some camping items to carry with you if you're planning on preparing some meals around the campfire. These frequent kitchen items allow you to duplicate tasty meals when you are out of doors.

• Salt and pepper
• Other of your favorite herbs and spices
• Cooking oil
• Pot holder

• Aluminum foil
• Tongs and spatula
• Cutting knives
• Cutting board
• Mixing bowl


In case you have just a few campers and are searching for some easy camp cooking, try out the easy and fast technique of tin could cooking. All you'll need is a fresh tin can -- a 1 gallon size may works well. Your source of heat can be a small campfire, or when wood burning is illegal, a little buddy burner may work nicely, which can be located at sporting good stores or online. Put your meal in the tin can and just heat the contents of your can over a fire.  This technique works great for soups, beans and poultry.

A more time-consuming camp cooking technique that also produces yummy meals is pit cooking.  It's also a great camp cooking method if you're using a dutch oven or cast iron cookware. Pit cooking calms your food by heating stones and coals which are buried in the floor. As the stones cool off, their emitted heat cooks the food. To pit cook, first dig a hole that is approximately three times larger than your own cookware. Line the pit with stones and build a fire in the center. When the fire has burnt rapidly for approximately an hour, push the warm coals and rocks into the center. Layer your wrapped food covered skillets in addition to the rocks and coals and place more on top. Following a couple of hours, you will have some tasty camp food to enjoy.
