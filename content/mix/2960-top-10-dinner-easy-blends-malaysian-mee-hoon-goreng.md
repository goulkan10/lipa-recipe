This makes crock pot cooking a win-win scenario since the costs involved with operating a crock marijuana are far less than the costs involved in operating a stove or oven generally. Whether electric or gas, your cooker and oven are often significant energy hogs.

Secondly, many good crock pot recipes incorporate the vegetables that guarantee we're getting the nutrients that we need. So often, when preparing a meal at the last moment, vegetables and other side dishes are left out in favour of expedience. Crock pot cooking in many cases is really a meal in 1 dish.

Another wonderful reason to use a crock pot for your summertime cooking is the ease of clean up.  Unlike pots and pans, many crock pot foods are made in 1 dish. This means that there is not going to be mountains of meals to be hand washed or loaded to the dishwasher (or in case you're like me-both) later. It's possible to spend less time cleaning as you spent less time slaving over a hot cooker. Oh wait! Make that time slaving over a hot cooker. After clean up is complete you can get back to enjoying the sun set, pursuing the lightening bugs along with your small ones, or even waiting for your very first celebrity.

While there'll never be a one size fits all best cooking method, crock pot cooking comes very near. In case you've got a crock pot gathering dust somewhere in the back of your pantry it is the right time to get out it, dust if offand dig some great summer crock pot cooking recipes.
