<i>Before you jump to Cauliflower rice &amp; chickpea tomato/curry sauce recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about {<strong>The Basics of Being Healthy</strong>.</i>
Getting A Healthy Eater

    
Camp cooking can be as elaborate or simple as you would like it to be. If you wish to prepare fast and easy but healthy meals while you're swimming, camp cooking does not even have to need a flame. However, if you are thinking about fueling your camping trip using a feast, camp cooking can make it possible for you to earn warm, healthy foods that are as good as you can create them at home in your kitchen.

Camp cooking does not have to be limited to sandwiches and baked potatoes wrapped in aluminum foil.  Just about any cooking method you use in the kitchen can be duplicated around the home. For example, use a toaster or pit cooking to consume your food. You might also easily fry foods at a bowl over a grill, or boil, braise and roast. Which kind of camping cookware is ideal for you? Camp cooking and cleanup can be easy or a hassle, but it all starts with great camping gear.

Some pots/pans come in sets that mate together or"nest" for storage and also let you tuck a canister of fuel inside them. This really also comes in handy once you're seeking to save space whilst camping.

Following are some camping things to consider with you if you are thinking about preparing some meals around the campfire. These frequent kitchen items will allow you to replicate yummy meals while you are out of doorways.

• Salt and pepper
• Other your favourite herbs and spices
• Cooking oil
• Pot holder
• Hand-held can opener
• Aluminum foil
• Tongs and spatula
• Cutting knives
• Cutting board
• Mixing bowl


When you have only a couple campers and are searching for some very simple camp cooking, try the simple and fast technique of tin can cooking. All you will need is a clean tin can -- a one gallon size can works nicely. Your source of warmth may be small campfire, or if wood burning is illegal, a small buddy burner may work well, which can be seen at sporting good stores or online. Place your meal from the tin can and easily warm the contents of your own can over a flame.  This technique works great for sauces, beans and tuna fish.

A more time-consuming camp cooking technique which also produces yummy food is pit cooking. Pit cooking is good for items which can be wrapped in aluminum foil to be cooked.  It's also a great camp cooking system if you are using a dutch oven or cast iron cookware. Pit cooking calms your food by heating rocks and coals that are concealed in the floor. As the rocks cool , their emitted heat cooks the food. To pit cook, first dig a hole that's about three times bigger than your cookware. Line the pit with stones and create a fire in the middle. When the fire has burnt rapidly for about an hour, push the hot coals and stone into the center. Layer your wrapped food covered skillets on top of the rocks and coals and place more on top. After a few hours, you'll have some tasty camp food to relish.

You can either use a box grater with the medium-size holes (pictured below) traditionally used for cheese, or a food processor with the grater blade to blitz it into small pieces. With both techniques you&#39;re aiming for little pieces the size of rice. First, cut your cauliflower into large florets. Place however many florets your food processor can hold and pulse until all of the cauliflower is small crumbs and looks like rice. Cauliflower rice is light and fluffy like rice, but a healthy alternative.
