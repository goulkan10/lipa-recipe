This is the first time i am trying this snack but have tasted the fried mathri from stores. Mathri is a flavorful, delicious savory crackers and there are few varieties like Methi, Peas,Dhaniya Mathri. Mathri is a traditional North Indian style crispy cracker generally prepared and feasted upon during festivals like Diwali and Karwa Chauth. When you bite into a Baked Methi Mathri, the flavours just explode on your palate. From the bitterness of fenugreek leaves and the spiciness of chilli powder to the appetizing taste of coriander powder, multiple flavours clamour for your attention.
