So, how can crock pot cooking really help beat the heat? In other words, the crock pot in and of itself sets off far less heat compared to cooking than the oven or stove top. This is the first and maybe the very best reason to use the crock pot in summer time meal planning. You should also look at the fact that by not heating the home by employing your stove or oven you're also avoiding your air conditioning (or other heating methods) from working overtime so as to compensate for the extra heat which other cooking methods pose.
