- "40 ml Milk"
- "1 whole egg Egg"
- "50 grams Sugar"
recipeinstructions:
- "Place the butter in a bowl. Steam and peel the sweet potatoes, cut them into easy-to-mash sizes and place into the bowl、then add in the sugar. Light brown sugar is also nice if you have it. Mix it all together so that there are no inconsistencies, and mash with a spatula etc. *Set aside a bit of unmashed sweet potato to use for the topping later."
- "Add a whisked egg into Step 1 and mix, add in milk and mix some more. Add in the pancake mix to that and stir some more."
- "This is what it should look like after stirring. I wanted to leave a bit of the sweet potato&#39;s texture in, so I mashed up the batter a bit roughly. Pour the batter into a muffin mold. I used a 5.9cm diameter and 4.5cm tall mold from the dollar store...to save money..."
- "Cut the sweet potato you set aside for the topping into cubes. If you dip these in syrup, then I think they turn out pretty nice upon baking. This time I used chestnuts that came with syrup, so I covered them in that. You don&#39;t have to do this, so please do as you like."
- "I added in too much and one turned out with not enough, but...I think it should turn out even if you add in 8 pieces each. Top them as you like on top of the batter that has been poured into the molds ."
- "Bake in an oven preheated to 180°C for about 30 minutes. They are done once you can poke them with a toothpick and it comes out clean Let them cool on a metal rack etc., and enjoy."
- "These are completed sweet potato muffins with the taste of Autumn. Please feel free to enjoy a more adult flavor by adding in brandy or lemon for fragrance It might also taste good topped with apples? I don&#39;t know At any rate, just enjoy cooking with ingredients available at home and cheap seasonal ingredients."

So, how can crock pot cooking help overcome the heat? To put it simply, the crock pot in and of itself puts off a lot less heat when cooking than an oven or stove top. Here is the first and possibly the very best reason to utilize the crock pot in your summer meal preparation. You should also look at the fact that by not heating the house by utilizing your stove or oven you are also preventing your air conditioning (or additional heating systems ) from working overtime so as to compensate for the additional heat that other cooking methods introduce.

This leaves crock pot cooking a win-win scenario since the expenses involved in operating a crock pot are much less than the costs involved in managing a cooker or stove in general. Whether gas or electric, your cooker and oven tend to be serious energy hogs. Add to that the fact that you are not increasing the warmth in your house by conventional way of cooking and you're using even less energy.

 The simple reality is that the crock pot ought to be one of the best loved and most frequently utilized cooking approaches in case it's possible to handle it.  Almost anything that can be boiled could be made in the crock pot and many, many more lovely and enticing foods and treats as well.

Secondly, many good crock pot recipes incorporate the vegetables that insure we're getting the nutrients we need. So often, when preparing a meal in the last minute, vegetables and other side dishes are left out in favour of expedience. Crock pot cooking many cases is a meal in 1 dish.

 Unlike vegetables and pans, most crock pot foods are created in 1 dish. This usually means that there is not going to be mountains of dishes to be either hand washed or packed to the dishwasher (or in case you're like me-both) afterwards. You can spend less time cleaning only as you spent time slaving over a hot cooker. Oh wait! Ensure time slaving over a hot cooker. Once tidy is complete you can contact enjoying the sunshine set, pursuing the lightening bugs with your small ones, or even waiting for your first celebrity.

While there will never be a one size fits all best cooking system, crock pot cooking comes very close. In case you have a crock pot gathering dust somewhere in the back of your pantry it is the right time to get out it, dust in the offand dig some great summer crock pot cooking recipes.
