<i>Before you jump to Jollof Rice with salad,pan fried shrimps with fried chicken recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about {<strong>The Basics of Being Healthy</strong>.</i>
Becoming A Healthy Eater

    
Camp cooking can be as complicated or simple as you want it to be. If you want to prepare quick and simple but healthy meals when you're swimming, camp cooking doesn't even need to require a flame. But if you're considering fueling your camping trip using a feast, camp cooking can allow you to earn warm, healthy foods that are as great as you can create them at home in your own kitchen.

Camp cooking does not need to be limited to sandwiches and baked potatoes wrapped in aluminum foil.  Just about any cooking procedure you use from the kitchen can be duplicated around the campfire. For instance, use a toaster or pit cooking to consume your meals. You can also easily fry foods in a bowl over a grill, or boil, braise and roast. Which type of camping cookware is ideal for you? Camp cooking and cleanup can be easy or a hassle, but it all starts with great camping equipment.

Some pots/pans arrive in places that mate collectively or"nest" for storage and also allow you to tuck a spoonful of fuel inside them. This really comes in handy when you're trying to save space whilst camping.

Following are some camping things to consider with you if you are planning on preparing some meals around the campfire. These common kitchen items will allow you to replicate yummy meals as you are out of doors.


• Other your favorite herbs and spices
• Cooking oil
• Pot holder

• Aluminum foil
• Tongs and spatula
• Cutting knives
• Cutting board
• Mixing bowl


In case you have only a few campers and are looking for some easy camp cooking, try out the easy and quick technique of tin can cooking. All you'll need is a clean tin can -- a one gallon size may works nicely. Your source of warmth can be a little campfire, or when wood burning is illegal, a small buddy burner may work well, which may be found at sporting good stores or online. Put your meal from the tin can and just warm the contents of your own can over a fire. You'll have a hot meal ready in seconds.  This technique works great for sauces, beans and poultry.

A more time-consuming camp cooking technique which also produces tasty food is pit cooking. Pit cooking is very good for items which could be wrapped in aluminum foil to be cooked.  It is also a great camp cooking system if you're using a dutch oven or cast iron cookware. Pit cooking calms your meals by heating rocks and coals that are buried in the ground. As the rocks cool , their emitted heat cooks the food. To pit cookfirst dig a hole that is approximately three times bigger than your own cookware. Line the pit with rocks and build a fire in the center. Once the fire has burnt rapidly for approximately an hourpush the warm coals and stone into the middle. Layer your wrapped meals covered skillets in addition to the rocks and coals and put more on top. After a couple of hours, you'll have some delicious camp food to enjoy.
