 Unlike pots and pans, most crock pot foods are created in 1 dish. This usually means that there will not be mountains of meals to be either hand washed or packed into the dishwasher (or if you're like me-both) later. It is possible to spend less time cleaning only as you spent less time slaving over a hot stove. Oh wait! Make that time slaving over a hot cooker. After clean up is complete you can get back to enjoying the sunshine set, chasing the lightening bugs along with your small ones, or waiting for your first superstar.

While there'll be no 1 size fits all ideal cooking method, crock pot cooking comes really near. In case you've got a crock pot gathering dust somewhere at the back of your pantry it's the right time to get it out, dust in the off, and dig up some amazing summertime crock pot cooking recipes.
