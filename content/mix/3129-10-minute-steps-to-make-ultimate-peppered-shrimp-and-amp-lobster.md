Becoming A Healthy Eater

    
Camp cooking can be as complicated or simple as you want it to be. If you want to prepare fast and easy but nutritious meals as you're swimming, camp cooking doesn't even have to require a flame. However, if you're considering fueling your camping trip with a feast, then camp cooking can allow you to earn hot, healthy foods that are as great as you can create them at home in your kitchen.

Camp cooking doesn't have to be limited to sandwiches and baked potatoes wrapped in aluminum foil.  Almost any cooking procedure you are using in the kitchen could be replicated around the campfire. For example, use a toaster or pit cooking to consume your meals. You may also easily fry foods in a pan over a grill, or boil, braise and beverage. Which sort of camping cookware is ideal for you? Camp cooking and clean-up may be easy or a hassle, it all starts with great camping equipment.

Some pots/pans come in sets that mate together or"nest" for storage and even allow you to tuck a spoonful of fuel inside them. This comes in handy when you're trying to save space whilst camping.

Following are some camping items to consider with you if you're considering preparing some meals around the home. These common kitchen items will allow you to duplicate tasty meals as you're out of doorways.


• Other of your favorite herbs and spices
• Cooking oil
• Pot holder
• Hand-held can opener
• Aluminum foil
• Tongs and spatula
• Cutting knives
• Cutting board
• Mixing bowl


If you have only a couple campers and are searching for some simple camp cooking, try out the easy and quick technique of tin can cooking. All you'll need is a clean tin can -- a 1 gallon size can works well. Your source of warmth may be little campfire, or when wood burning is illegal, a little buddy burner may work nicely, which can be located at sporting good stores or online. Put your meal in the tin can and just warm the contents of your can over a flame. You will have a hot meal ready in minutes.  This technique works great for soups, beans and tuna fish.

A more time-consuming camp cooking technique that also produces delectable meals is pit cooking.  It's also a great camp cooking system if you're using a dutch oven or cast iron cookware. Pit cooking calms your meals by heating stones and coals which are buried in the floor. As the rocks cool , their emitted heat cooks the food. To pit cookfirst dig a hole that is roughly three times bigger than your cookware. Line the pit with rocks and create a fire in the middle. When the fire has burned rapidly for about an hour, push the hot coals and stone into the middle. Layer your wrapped meals or covered skillets on top of the stones and coals and put on top. After a number of hours, you'll have some tasty camp food to enjoy.
