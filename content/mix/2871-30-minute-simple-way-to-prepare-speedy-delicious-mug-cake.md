This makes crock pot cooking a win-win scenario as the expenses involved with operating a crock pot are much less compared to the expenses related to managing a stove or oven in general. Whether gas or electric, your stove and oven are often serious energy hogs. Add to the fact that you're not raising the temperature in your house by conventional means of cooking and you're using less power.

Unfortunately for many, the general consensus has been the crock pots were intended for comfort foods and hearty winter meals.  The truth is that the crock pot ought to be one of the best loved and most frequently utilized cooking techniques in case you can handle it.

Secondly, many great crock pot recipes include the vegetables that insure we are getting the nutrients that we need. So often, when preparing a meal at the last moment, vegetables and other side dishes are made in favor of expedience. Crock pot cooking many cases is really a meal in one dish.

One other terrific reason to use a crock pot for the summer cooking is that the ease of clean up.  Unlike pans and pans, most crock pot dishes are created in one dish. This means that there will not be mountains of dishes to be hand cleaned or loaded to the dishwasher (or if you're like me-both) later. It's possible to spend less time cleaning as you spent time slaving over a hot cooker. Oh wait! Ensure time slaving over a hot cooker. Once clean up is complete you can get back to enjoying the sunshine set, chasing the lightening bugs along with your small ones, or waiting for the very first star.

While there will never be a 1 size fits all ideal cooking method, crock pot cooking comes really close. When you have a crock pot collecting dust somewhere at the back of your pantry it is time to get it out, dust off, and dig some amazing summertime crock pot cooking recipes.
