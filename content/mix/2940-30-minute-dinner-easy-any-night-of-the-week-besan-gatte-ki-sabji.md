 Unlike pans and pans, many crock pot dishes are created in one dish. This means that there isn't going to be mountains of meals to be hand cleaned or packed into the dishwasher (or in case you are like me-both) later. It is possible to spend less time cleaning only as you spent less time slaving over a hot cooker. Oh wait! Ensure time slaving over a hot cooker. After clean up is complete you can get back to enjoying the sun set, pursuing the lightening bugs along with your small ones, or even waiting for the very first celebrity.
