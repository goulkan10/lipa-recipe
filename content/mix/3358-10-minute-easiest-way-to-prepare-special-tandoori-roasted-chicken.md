This usually means that there isn't going to be mountains of dishes to be either hand washed or packed into the dishwasher (or in case you're like me-both) afterwards. You can spend less time cleaning just as you spent less time slaving over a hot stove. Oh wait! Make that no time slaving over a hot stove. After clean up is complete you can contact enjoying the sun set, chasing the lightening bugs along with your small ones, or even waiting for your very first star.
