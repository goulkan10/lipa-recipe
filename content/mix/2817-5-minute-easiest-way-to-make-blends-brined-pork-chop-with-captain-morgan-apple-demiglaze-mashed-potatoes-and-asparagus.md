Often, a salad of fresh vegetables with chopped ham, roast beef or chicken is more appealing than traditional menu items.  Salads are particularly appealing in the summer months because they're lighter on the digestive system.

Restaurants that contain foods in year cultivated by local farmers offer quite healthy and affordable choices. Some of these kinds of restaurants will make their own recipes for healthy food options.  This provides the customer with a totally new selection and motivates them to visit the restaurant again.

Seeing a neighborhood grocery store or supermarket highlights the number of healthy choices which are readily available.

Try any burger double or triple stacked. Two house brined center cut pork chops, whiskey bbq glaze, topped with onion strings &amp; served with cheddar mashed potatoes Steak &amp; Shrooms* Two tenderloin filets, sautéed mushrooms, caramelized onions, smoked provolone with fried mushrooms, piquant sauce &amp; crispy potatoes. A gourmet blend of Certified Angus Beef® ground chuck, brisket and short rib, hand pattied and served on a toasted sourdough bun dressed with lettuce, tomato and red onion. The food was excellent, our waiter, Jerry, was delightful, knowledgeable and helpful.
