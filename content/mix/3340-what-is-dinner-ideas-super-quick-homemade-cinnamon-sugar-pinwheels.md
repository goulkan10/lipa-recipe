This means that there will not be mountains of meals to be hand washed or packed into the dishwasher (or in case you're like me-both) later. It's possible to spend less time cleaning as you spent less time slaving over a hot cooker. Oh wait! Make that time slaving over a hot stove. After clean up is complete you can get back to enjoying the sunshine set, chasing the lightening bugs with your little ones, or even waiting for the first celebrity.

While there'll be no 1 size fits all ideal cooking method, crock pot cooking comes really close. When you have a crock pot gathering dust somewhere in the back of your pantry it is time to get out it, dust in the off, and dig up some terrific summertime crock pot cooking recipes.

Cinnamon and Apple Pinwheels with Brown Butter Cream Cheese Icing. If you&#39;d like to serve these in Stewed apples: Place the apple cubes, sugar and cinnamon in a small saucepan over a low heat.
