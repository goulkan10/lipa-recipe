You could also easily fry foods at a pan over a grill, or boil, braise and beverage. What kind of camping cookware is best for you? Camp cooking and clean-up can be easy or a hassle, it all starts with great camping gear.

Some pots/pans arrive in places that partner together or"nest" for storage and even let you tuck a spoonful of fuel inside them. This comes in handy when you're seeking to save space whilst camping.

If you have only a couple of campers and are searching for some very easy camp cooking, try out the easy and quick technique of tin can cooking. All you'll need is a clean tin can -- a 1 gallon size may works nicely. Your source of warmth may be small campfire, or when wood burning is illegal, a little buddy burner will work nicely, which can be found at sporting good stores or online. Place your meal from the tin can and simply heat the contents of your own can over a fire. You will have a hot meal ready in minutes.  This technique works great for sauces, beans and tuna fish.

A more time-consuming camp cooking technique which also produces yummy meals is pit cooking.  It's also a wonderful camp cooking method if you are using a dutch oven or cast iron cookware.

To pit cookfirst dig a hole that is about three times larger than your own cookware. Line the pit with rocks and create a fire in the center. When the flame has burnt rapidly for about an hourpush the warm coals and rocks into the center. Layer your wrapped meals or covered skillets on top of the stones and coals and place on top. After a few hours, you'll have some delicious camp food to enjoy.
