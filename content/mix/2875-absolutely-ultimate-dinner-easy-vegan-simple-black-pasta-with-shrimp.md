After the weather warms up, the kitchen can be a terrible place to be.

So, how can crock pot cooking really help beat the heat? To put it simply, that the crock pot in and of itself sets off much less heat compared to cooking than the oven or stove top. This is the very first and possibly the best reason to use the crock pot in summer time meal planning. You should also consider the fact that by not heating the home by employing your stove or oven you are also preventing your air conditioning (or additional cooling systems ) from working overtime so as to compensate for the extra heat that other cooking methods introduce.

This leaves crock pot cooking a win-win scenario since the costs involved in managing a crock pot are far less compared to the costs involved in operating a cooker or stove generally. Whether electric or gas, your stove and oven tend to be considerable energy hogs. Add to this the fact that you're not raising the warmth in your house by traditional means of cooking and you're using even less energy.

Another terrific reason to use a crock pot for the summertime cooking is the ease of clean up.  Unlike vegetables and pans, most crock pot foods are made in one dish. This means that there isn't going to be mountains of meals to be either hand washed or packed into the dishwasher (or in case you are like me-both) later. You can spend less time cleaning as you spent time slaving over a hot cooker. Oh wait! Ensure no time slaving over a hot cooker. After clean up is complete you can get back to enjoying the sunshine set, pursuing the lightening bugs along with your small ones, or even waiting for your first celebrity.

While there'll never be a 1 size fits all very ideal cooking system, crock pot cooking comes very close. If you have a crock pot gathering dust somewhere at the back of your pantry it's the right time to get it out, dust in the offand dig some great summer crock pot cooking recipes.
