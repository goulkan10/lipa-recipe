This is the first and possibly the best reason to use the crock pot on summer time meal planning. You should also consider that by not heating your home by utilizing your stove or oven you are also avoiding your air conditioning (or alternative cooling systems ) from working overtime so as to compensate for the additional heat which other cooking methods introduce.

Whether electric or gas, your cooker and oven are often serious energy hogs. Add to this the fact that you are not increasing the warmth in your home by traditional way of cooking and you are using even less electricity.

Besides the cost advantages cited above when it comes to crock pot cooking there are a number of other benefits which are worth mentioning.

So frequently, when planning a meal in the last moment, vegetables and other side dishes have been left out in favour of expedience. Crock pot cooking many instances is really a meal in one dish.

One other terrific reason to use a crock pot for your summertime cooking is the ease of clean up.  Unlike vegetables and pans, most crock pot dishes are created in one dish. This means that there won't be mountains of meals to be hand cleaned or packed into the dishwasher (or if you are like me-both) later. It's possible to spend less time cleaning just as you spent time slaving over a hot cooker. Oh wait! Ensure no time slaving over a hot stove. Once clean up is complete you can get back to enjoying the sun set, chasing the lightening bugs along with your small ones, or even waiting for the very first star.

While there will be no 1 size fits all best cooking procedure, crock pot cooking comes very near. When you have a crock pot gathering dust somewhere at the back of your pantry it's the right time to get out it, dust if off, and dig up some fantastic summertime crock pot cooking recipes.
