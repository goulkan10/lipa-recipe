- " Biscuit Batter"
- "2 cups all purpose flour"

- "3/4 tsp. salt"
- "3/4 tsp. garlic powder"
- "1/4 cup frozen butter grated"

- "1 heaping cup freshly shredded cheddar cheese"
- " Buttery Topping"
- "3 tbsp. unsalted butter melted"
- "1/8 tsp. each salt garlic powder"
- "1/4 tsp. dried parsley"
recipeinstructions:
- "Preheat your oven to 400°F. Line a large baking pan with parchment paper and set it aside. In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, parsley, salt and garlic powder. Then use a fork or pastry cutter to cut in the frozen, grated butter until it resembles small peas."
- "Fold in the buttermilk, then the shredded cheese until just combined. Careful not to overmix the batter or your biscuits will be dense. Use either a medium sized cookie scoop or two large spoons to drop the batter onto the baking pan, keeping an inch or two of space between them, as they will expand a bit in the oven."

While they are baking, whisk together the ingredients for the buttery topping in a small bowl and set them aside. Once the biscuits are done, immediately brush them with the buttery mixture and serve them warm."

<i>Before you jump to Cheddar Drop Biscuits recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about {<strong>The Simple Ways to Be Healthy</strong>.</i>
Getting A Healthy Eater

It is possible for people to make healthy food options even though they simply have a brief time in which to prepare their foods. The first point to see is that it's frequently that healthy choices do not always indicate a need for two-hour meals. A person can pick healthy foods that are fast and simple to prepare at home or to pick out of a takeout place. Cities often provide restaurant guides in their phone books that exhibit full-page menus suggesting what a particular restaurant or drive-thru provides. A number of these food sellers now include healthy alternatives to their usual fast-food selection.

At locations like McDonald's and Hardee's, it's possible to find customers who are worried in their carbohydrate intake.  This has motivated the restaurants to supply other options within their burger choices. Hamburgers can be ordered with no bun, for instance, and fruit and yogurt are contained on the menu together with fresh cakes. Many restaurants provide salad options either as unwanted orders or as total meals. Often, a salad of fresh vegetables with chopped ham, roast beef or poultry is much more appealing than normal menu items.  Salads are particularly appealing in the summer months because they are milder on the digestive system.

Restaurants that contain foods in season cultivated by local farmers offer very healthy and affordable choices.  This provides the consumer with a totally fresh choice and promotes them to visit the restaurant .

If home preparation of meals is preferred, the alternatives for healthy choices grow. Visiting a neighborhood grocery store or grocery store highlights the amount of healthy choices which are readily available.  All kinds of cuisine can be ready quickly because of the choices of new goods instead of frozen foods. There are many choices of frozen foods as well. The demand for healthy frozen dinners and other meals has increased alongside demands for greater variety in food that is frozen offerings. Any frozen food aisle at almost any supermarket will reveal as lots of healthy food options and bad choices. The decision is up to the person.

People may either choose to consume a healthy diet program or an unhealthy one. Time and access to healthy choices are no longer problems for a person who is trying to eat better and wholesome foods.
