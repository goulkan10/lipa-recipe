Watch this closely because the sauce will go from very thin to thick quickly. The best ever Sweet and Sour Pork recipe is loaded with tricks the Chinese have been using for centuries: double dredge and double fry for extra crispy, cornflour instead of flour, economical pork used for juiciness, but tenderised with baking soda so you&#39;d swear they&#39;re pricey chops, and a sauce that&#39;s not sickeningly sweet. In a large skillet, brown the pork chops on both sides. Add the broth, vinegar, brown sugar, onion, soy sauce, pineapple, and green pepper. In a dutch oven or large skillet, brown the pork chops.
