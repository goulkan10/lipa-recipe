Here is the first and possibly the best reason to utilize the crock pot on your summer meal planning. You should also consider the fact that by not heating your home by using your stove top or oven you're also preventing your air conditioning (or alternative cooling systems ) from working overtime so as to compensate for the additional heat that other cooking systems introduce.

This usually means that there won't be mountains of dishes to be either hand washed or loaded into the dishwasher (or if you're like me-both) afterwards. It is possible to spend less time cleaning only as you spent time slaving over a hot cooker. Oh wait! Make that no time slaving over a hot stove. Once clean up is complete you can contact enjoying the sunshine set, chasing the lightening bugs with your small ones, or even waiting for your very first star.
