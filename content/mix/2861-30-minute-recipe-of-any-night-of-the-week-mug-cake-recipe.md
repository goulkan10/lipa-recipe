<i>Before you jump to Mug cake recipe recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about {<strong>The Basics of Being Healthy</strong>.</i>
Becoming A Healthy Eater

    
Camp cooking can be as complicated or simple as you would like it to be. If you want to prepare quick and easy but healthy meals when you're swimming, camp cooking doesn't even have to need a flame. But if you're thinking about ridding your camping trip using a feast, camp cooking can allow you to earn warm, healthy foods which are as good as you can make them at home in your own kitchen.

Camp cooking doesn't have to be limited to sandwiches and baked potatoes wrapped in aluminum foil.  Almost any cooking procedure you are using in the kitchen can be duplicated around the campfire. For example, use a dutch oven or pit cooking to consume your food. You may also easily bake foods at a pan over a grill, or boil, braise and roast. Which kind of camping cookware is ideal for you? Camp cooking and clean-up can be easy or a hassle, and it all starts with great camping gear.

Some pots/pans arrive in sets that mate collectively or"nest" for storage and even allow you to tuck a canister of fuel inside them. This really comes in handy when you're looking to save space whilst camping.

Following are some camping things to take with you if you are planning on preparing some meals around the home. These common kitchen items will allow you to duplicate tasty meals as you are out of doorways.


• Other of your favourite herbs and spices
• Cooking oil
• Pot holder

• Aluminum foil
• Tongs and spatula
• Cutting knives
• Cutting board
• Mixing bowl


In case you have just a couple of campers and are looking for some very simple camp cooking, try out the simple and fast technique of tin can cooking. All you will need is a clean tin can -- a 1 gallon size can works well. Your source of warmth may be little campfire, or when wood burning is illegal, a small buddy burner will work nicely, which can be found at sporting good stores or online. Put your meal from the tin can and just warm the contents of your can over a fire.  This technique works great for sauces, beans and poultry.

A more time-consuming camp cooking technique that also produces tasty food is pit cooking.  It's also a excellent camp cooking system if you are using a dutch oven or cast iron cookware. Pit cooking warms your food by heating rocks and coals which are concealed in the ground. As the stones cool away, their emitted heat cooks the food. To pit cook, first dig a hole that's roughly three times bigger than your own cookware. Line the pit with stones and construct a fire in the middle. When the flame has burnt rapidly for approximately one hour, push the hot coals and rocks into the middle. Twist your wrapped food or covered skillets on top of the stones and coals and place more on top. After a number of hours, you will have some tasty camp food to enjoy.
