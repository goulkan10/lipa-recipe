But if you're interested in ridding your camping trip with a feast, then camp cooking can enable you to earn warm, healthy foods that are as good as you can make them at home in your own kitchen.

 Just about any cooking process you use in the kitchen could be replicated around the campfire. For example, use a dutch oven or pit cooking to bake your food. You might also easily bake foods in a pan over a grill, or boil, braise and beverage. Which type of camping cookware is best for you?
