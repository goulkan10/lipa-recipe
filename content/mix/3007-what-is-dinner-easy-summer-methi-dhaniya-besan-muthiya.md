Getting A Healthy Eater

    
Camp cooking can be as elaborate or simple as you want it to be. If you want to prepare quick and easy but healthy meals as you're camping, camp cooking doesn't even need to require a flame. However, if you're thinking about fueling your camping excursion with a feast, camp cooking can make it possible for you to earn warm, healthy foods that are as great as you can create them at home in your own kitchen.

Camp cooking does not need to be limited to sandwiches and baked potatoes wrapped in aluminum foil.  Just about any cooking system you use in the kitchen could be duplicated around the home. For instance, use a dutch oven or pit cooking to bake your meals. You could also easily fry foods in a bowl over a grill, or boil, braise and roast. Which sort of camping cookware is best for you? Camp cooking and clean-up may be easy or a hassle, and it all starts with great camping equipment.

Some pots/pans come in sets that partner together or"nest" for storage and even allow you to tuck a canister of fuel inside them. This really comes in handy once you're trying to save space while camping.

Listed below are some camping things to carry with you if you're considering preparing some meals around the campfire. These common kitchen items allow you to replicate yummy meals as you are out of doorways.


• Other of your favorite herbs and spices
• Cooking oil
• Pot holder

• Aluminum foil

• Cutting knives
• Cutting board
• Mixing bowl


When you have just a few campers and are searching for some simple camp cooking, try the easy and quick technique of tin can cooking. All you will need is a fresh tin can -- a one gallon size may works nicely. Your source of heat can be a little campfire, or if wood burning is prohibited, a small buddy burner may work well, which can be found at sporting good stores or online. Put your meal from the tin can and just warm the contents of your can over a flame. You'll have a hot meal ready in minutes.  This technique works great for soups, beans and tuna fish.

A more time-consuming pub cooking technique which also produces yummy food is pit cooking.  It is also a excellent camp cooking method if you're using a dutch oven or cast iron cookware. Pit cooking calms your meals by heating rocks and coals which are concealed in the floor. As the stones cool away, their emitted heat cooks the food. To pit cook, first dig a hole that is about three times bigger than your own cookware. Line the pit with rocks and construct a fire in the center. When the fire has burned rapidly for about an hour, push the warm coals and rocks into the center. Twist your wrapped meals covered skillets on top of the rocks and coals and place more on top. After a few hours, you will have some tasty camp food to relish.
