Getting A Healthy Eater

    
Camp cooking can be as elaborate or simple as you want it to be. If you wish to prepare fast and simple but nutritious meals when you're swimming, camp cooking doesn't even need to require a fire. However, if you're thinking about fueling your camping trip having a feast, camp cooking can allow you to make warm, healthy foods which are as good as you can create them at home in your own kitchen.

Camp cooking doesn't have to be limited to sandwiches and baked potatoes wrapped in aluminum foil.  Just about any cooking method you are using from the kitchen can be replicated around the home. For example, use a toaster or pit cooking to consume your meals. You can also easily bake foods at a bowl over a grill, or boil, braise and beverage. What kind of camping cookware is ideal for you? Camp cooking and clean-up can be easy or a hassle, and it all starts with great camping gear.

Some pots/pans come in sets that mate together or"nest" for storage and even allow you to tuck a canister of gas within them. This really comes in handy when you're wanting to save space whilst camping.

Following are some camping things to take with you if you're considering preparing some meals around the home. These frequent kitchen items allow you to replicate yummy meals as you're out of doorways.


• Other of your favourite herbs and spices
• Cooking oil
• Pot holder
• Hand-held can opener
• Aluminum foil
• Tongs and spatula
• Cutting knives
• Cutting board
• Mixing bowl
• Paper or plastic silverware, plates and cups

When you have only a few campers and are looking for some simple camp cooking, try the easy and fast technique of tin can cooking. All you'll need is a clean tin can -- a one gallon size may works well. Your source of warmth can be a small campfire, or when wood burning is prohibited, a little buddy burner may work nicely, which can be found at sporting good stores or online. Place your meal in the tin can and simply heat the contents of your can over a flame. You'll have a hot meal ready in seconds.  This technique works great for sauces, beans and poultry.

A more time-consuming pub cooking technique which also produces tasty food is pit cooking. Pit cooking is excellent for items that could be wrapped in aluminum foil to be cooked.  It's also a great camp cooking method if you are using a dutch oven or cast iron cookware. Pit cooking warms your meals by heating rocks and coals that are concealed in the ground. As the rocks cool away, their emitted heat cooks the meals. To pit cook, first dig a hole that is about three times larger than your own cookware. Line the pit with rocks and create a fire in the center. When the flame has burned rapidly for about one hourpush the warm coals and stones into the middle. Layer your wrapped meals covered skillets in addition to the stones and coals and place more on top. After a couple of hours, you'll have some delicious camp food to enjoy.
