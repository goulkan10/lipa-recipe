Sticky Rice Dumplings (Banh It Tran) Here&#39;s an easy-to-follow recipe for Sticky Rice Dumplings (Banh It Tran), a popular Vietnamese savory dumpling often enjoyed as a snack or small bite. Vietnamese cuisine is replete with snack foods, small bites and casual eats and these savory dumplings are some of the heartiest and most addicting treats. The leaf-wrapped sticky rice dumplings zongzi (in Mandarin) or joong (Cantonese) are a snack enjoyed year-round in China, though they are especially popular in the spring. Dragon boat racing isn&#39;t a tradition in the North-west of China where I grew up. Glutinous rice dumplings (aka hom sui gok) combine a savory pork and shrimp filling with a sweet glutinous rice shell.
