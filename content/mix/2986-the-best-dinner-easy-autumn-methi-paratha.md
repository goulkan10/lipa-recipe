 Unlike pans and pans, most crock pot foods are created in 1 dish. This usually means that there will not be mountains of meals to be hand cleaned or loaded to the dishwasher (or in case you are like me-both) afterwards. You're able to spend less time cleaning only as you spent less time slaving over a hot stove. Oh wait! Make that time slaving over a hot cooker. Once tidy is complete you can get back to enjoying the sunshine set, chasing the lightening bugs with your small ones, or waiting for the first celebrity.

While there'll be no 1 size fits all best cooking method, crock pot cooking comes very close. If you've got a crock pot gathering dust somewhere at the rear of your pantry it is the right time to get it out, dust off, and dig up some fantastic summer crock pot cooking recipes.
