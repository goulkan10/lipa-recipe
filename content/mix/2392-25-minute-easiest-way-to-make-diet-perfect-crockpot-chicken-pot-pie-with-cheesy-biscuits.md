Towards the end of the cook time of this great recipe, bake the biscuits and serve. This chicken pot pie is baked to perfection with a biscuit topping. Instead of the usual pastry crust, this chicken pie is topped with savory cheese biscuits. The biscuit dough is rolled to a pan-size rectangle and the biscuits are cut into squares, so none of the dough is wasted. A pizza cutter makes it easy to cut the dough into uniform squares.
