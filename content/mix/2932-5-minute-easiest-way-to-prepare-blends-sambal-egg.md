Becoming A Healthy Eater

    
Camp cooking can be as elaborate or simple as you want it to be. If you would like to prepare quick and simple but healthy meals when you're swimming, camp cooking doesn't even have to require a flame. However, if you're thinking about fueling your camping trip having a feast, camp cooking can make it possible for you to make hot, healthy foods which are as good as you can create them at home in your kitchen.

Camp cooking doesn't have to be limited to sandwiches and baked potatoes wrapped in aluminum foil.  Almost any cooking procedure you use from the kitchen can be replicated around the home. For example, use a dutch oven or pit cooking to consume your meals. You might also easily bake foods at a pan over a grill, or boil, braise and roast. What kind of camping cookware is best for you? Camp cooking and cleanup can be easy or a hassle, it all starts with great camping equipment.

Some pots/pans arrive in sets that mate collectively or"nest" for storage and even allow you to tuck a spoonful of gas within them. This really also comes in handy when you're searching to save space while camping.

Listed below are some camping things to carry with you if you're planning on preparing some meals around the home. These frequent kitchen items will allow you to duplicate tasty meals while you are out of doors.

• Salt and pepper
• Other your favorite herbs and spices
• Cooking oil
• Pot holder

• Aluminum foil

• Cutting knives
• Cutting board
• Mixing bowl


If you have just a couple campers and are looking for some simple camp cooking, try out the simple and fast technique of tin can cooking. All you will need is a clean tin can -- a 1 gallon size may works well. Your source of heat can be a little campfire, or if wood burning is illegal, a small buddy burner will work well, which can be seen at sporting good stores or online. Put your meal in the tin can and simply warm the contents of your can over a flame. You'll have a hot meal ready in minutes.  This technique works great for soups, beans and poultry.

A more time-consuming camp cooking technique which also produces yummy meals is pit cooking.  It's also a wonderful camp cooking system if you're using a dutch oven or cast iron cookware. Pit cooking warms your food by heating rocks and coals that are buried in the floor. As the rocks cool , their emitted heat cooks the food. To pit cookfirst dig a hole that's approximately three times larger than your cookware. Line the pit with stones and create a fire in the center. Once the flame has burned rapidly for approximately an hour, push the hot coals and stone into the middle. Twist your wrapped meals or covered skillets in addition to the rocks and coals and put on top. Following a few hours, you'll have some tasty camp food to enjoy.
