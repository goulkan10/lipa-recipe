This leaves crock pot cooking a win-win situation as the expenses involved with operating a crock pot are much less than the costs involved in operating a stove or oven generally. Whether gas or electric, your stove and oven are often significant energy hogs.

It is possible to spend less time cleaning just as you spent time slaving over a hot cooker. Oh wait! Make that no time slaving over a hot stove. Once clean up is complete you can get back to enjoying the sun set, chasing the lightening bugs with your small ones, or even waiting for the first celebrity.

While there will never be a one size fits all very best cooking method, crock pot cooking comes really near. If you have a crock pot gathering dust somewhere at the back of your pantry it's time to get it out, dust in the offand dig some terrific summertime crock pot cooking recipes.
