A bagel is a great way to begin the day.

Make the ideal food choices.

They are- These Indian style french fries aka Alu Kadai, were a big big hit with him. Of course Alan saw them and they were a big, big hit with him too, except that time he wasn&#39;t getting any. But it was such a great dish and so amazingly easy to fix that I decided I&#39;d definitely be making it again soon. So yesterday after tinkering with it a bit, I did. And that&#39;s when the trouble started.
