<i>Before you jump to Shrimp Biryani recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about {<strong>The Simple Ways to Be Healthy</strong>.</i>
Getting A Healthy Eater

    
Camp cooking can be as complicated or simple as you want it to be. If you would like to prepare quick and simple but nutritious meals when you're camping, camp cooking doesn't even have to require a fire. But if you're thinking about fueling your camping trip having a feast, then camp cooking can allow you to earn warm, healthy foods that are as good as you can make them at home in your own kitchen.

 Just about any cooking method you use from the kitchen can be duplicated around the home. For example, use a dutch oven or pit cooking to consume your meals. You may also easily fry foods in a pan over a grill, or boil, braise and beverage. What kind of camping cookware is best for you? Camp cooking and clean-up can be easy or a hassle, and it all starts with great camping gear.

Some pots/pans arrive in sets that mate jointly or"nest" for storage and also let you tuck a spoonful of gas within them. This comes in handy when you're seeking to save space while camping.

Following are some camping things to take with you if you are considering preparing some meals around the campfire. These common kitchen items allow you to duplicate tasty meals when you are out of doorways.


• Other your favorite herbs and spices
• Cooking oil
• Pot holder
• Hand-held can opener
• Aluminum foil

• Cutting knives
• Cutting board
• Mixing bowl
• Paper or plastic silverware, plates and cups

If you have only a couple of campers and are searching for some easy camp cooking, try the easy and fast technique of tin can cooking. All you will need is a clean tin can -- a one gallon size may works nicely. Your source of heat may be small campfire, or if wood burning is illegal, a little buddy burner will work well, which may be found at sporting good stores or online. Place your meal from the tin can and easily heat the contents of your own can over a flame. You will have a hot meal ready in seconds.  This technique works great for soups, beans and tuna fish.

A more time-consuming camp cooking technique which also produces tasty food is pit cooking.  It's also a excellent camp cooking method if you are using a dutch oven or cast iron cookware. Pit cooking warms your food by heating rocks and coals which are buried in the floor. As the stones cool , their emitted heat cooks the meals. To pit cook, first dig a hole that is about three times larger than your cookware. Line the pit with stones and construct a fire in the center. Once the flame has burnt rapidly for about an hourpush the warm coals and stone into the middle. Twist your wrapped meals or covered skillets on top of the stones and coals and put more on top. After a number of hours, you'll have some delicious camp food to enjoy.
