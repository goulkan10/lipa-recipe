This is the first and maybe the best reason to use the crock pot on your summer meal preparation.

Unfortunately for most, the general consensus was the crock pots were intended for comfort foods and hearty winter foods.  The simple truth is that the crock pot should be one of your most loved and most often utilized cooking approaches if you can handle it.

Secondly, many good crock pot recipes incorporate the vegetables that insure we are getting the nutrients that we need. So frequently, when planning a meal at the last minute, vegetables and other side dishes have been made in favor of expedience. Crock pot cooking in many instances is really a meal in 1 dish.

One other excellent reason to use a crock pot for the summertime cooking is that the ease of clean up.  Unlike pots and pans, most crock pot meals are created in 1 dish. This usually means that there won't be mountains of dishes to be either hand cleaned or loaded into the dishwasher (or in case you're like me-both) later. You can spend less time cleaning as you spent less time slaving over a hot cooker. Oh wait! Ensure no time slaving over a hot cooker. After clean up is complete you can contact enjoying the sun set, chasing the lightening bugs along with your small ones, or even waiting for your very first superstar.

While there'll be no 1 size fits all ideal cooking process, crock pot cooking comes really close. When you've got a crock pot collecting dust somewhere in the back of your pantry it's the right time to get it out, dust off, and dig up some amazing summertime crock pot cooking recipes.
