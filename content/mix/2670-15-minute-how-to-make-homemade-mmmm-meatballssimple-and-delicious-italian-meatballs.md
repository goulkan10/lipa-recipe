Heat oil in a large frying pan over medium-high heat. Add pasta sauce to pan and stir to combine. These easy meatballs are made with beef and pork for the perfect blend of flavors. You can use any ground meat including veal, lamb or sausage. If your meat is very lean (like in my Turkey Meatballs) I sometimes add a little bit of extra fat like a tablespoon of olive oil or some raw chopped bacon.
