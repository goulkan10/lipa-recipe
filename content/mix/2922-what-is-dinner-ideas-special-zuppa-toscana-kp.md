This makes crock pot cooking a win-win scenario since the expenses involved in managing a crock pot are much less compared to the expenses related to operating a stove or oven in general. Whether electric or gas, your stove and oven tend to be serious energy hogs.

Another fantastic reason to use a crock pot for your summer cooking is that the ease of clean up.  Unlike pans and pans, most crock pot meals are made in one dish. This usually means that there isn't going to be mountains of dishes to be either hand cleaned or packed to the dishwasher (or in case you are like me-both) afterwards. You can spend less time cleaning only as you spent less time slaving over a hot cooker. Oh wait! Ensure time slaving over a hot stove. Once clean up is complete you can get back to enjoying the sun set, pursuing the lightening bugs with your small ones, or even waiting for your very first celebrity.

While there'll be no one size fits all ideal cooking procedure, crock pot cooking comes very near. When you have a crock pot gathering dust somewhere at the rear of your pantry it's the right time to get out it, dust offand dig up some great summer crock pot cooking recipes.
