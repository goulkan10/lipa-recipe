I love the subtle scent of Jasmine rice and I like to use medium-grained rice. Transfer the steamed rice to a baking sheet to cool to room temperature. To make the fried rice and serve: Fried Rice is a combination of long grained rice, mixture of warm peas, carrots and onions with scrambled eggs mixed all together! You will not be getting take out any longer! Have fried rice as an entree or a side dish when serving it!
