Becoming A Healthy Eater

    
Camp cooking can be as complicated or simple as you would like it to be. If you wish to prepare quick and easy but nutritious meals as you're camping, camp cooking doesn't even have to require a flame. However, if you are thinking about ridding your camping excursion using a feast, camp cooking can make it possible for you to make warm, healthy foods that are as good as you can make them at home in your own kitchen.

 Just about any cooking process you are using from the kitchen could be duplicated around the campfire. For example, use a toaster or pit cooking to bake your meals. You can also easily fry foods in a bowl over a grill, or boil, braise and beverage. Which type of camping cookware is ideal for you? Camp cooking and clean-up may be easy or a hassle, and it all starts with great camping gear.

Some pots/pans come in places that partner jointly or"nest" for storage and even let you tuck a canister of gas within them. This really comes in handy when you're searching to save room while camping.

Following are some camping items to carry with you if you are considering preparing some meals around the campfire. These frequent kitchen items will allow you to duplicate tasty meals while you're out of doors.


• Other of your favourite herbs and spices
• Cooking oil
• Pot holder
• Hand-held can opener
• Aluminum foil
• Tongs and spatula
• Cutting knives
• Cutting board
• Mixing bowl


In case you have only a couple campers and are searching for some simple camp cooking, try out the easy and quick technique of tin could cooking. All you'll need is a clean tin can -- a 1 gallon size may works well. Your source of warmth can be a little campfire, or if wood burning is illegal, a little buddy burner may work nicely, which can be found at sporting good stores or online. Place your meal from the tin can and simply warm the contents of your own can over a fire.  This technique works great for soups, beans and poultry.

A more time-consuming pub cooking technique that also produces tasty meals is pit cooking.  It's also a great camp cooking system if you're using a dutch oven or cast iron cookware. Pit cooking warms your food by heating stones and coals that are concealed in the ground. As the rocks cool away, their emitted heat cooks the meals. To pit cook, first dig a hole that's about three times larger than your own cookware. Line the pit with stones and create a fire in the middle. Once the flame has burnt rapidly for approximately one hour, push the hot coals and stones into the middle. Layer your wrapped food covered skillets on top of the stones and coals and put more on top. After a number of hours, you will have some tasty camp food to relish.
