recipeinstructions:

- "Make a well in the centre and stir in the apple / orange juice, oil and yeast mixture"
- "Form a sticky but soft dough using your hands. Depending on the flour used you may need to add a little more milk as gluten-free flours need more liquid, 2 -3 tbsp should be plenty"

<i>Before you jump to Vickys Easter Apple Cinnamon Hot Cross Buns, GF DF EF SF NF recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about {<strong>Easy Ways to Get Healthy</strong>.</i>
Getting A Healthy Eater


After the weather warms warms up, the kitchen may be a horrible place to be. There are several things you can do however, in regards to cooking a nice home made meal which does not require traditional stove top or oven cooking. Learn how to utilize some of the heat producing equipment in your own kitchen, such as the crock pot, in order to genuinely conquer the summer heat and maintain your cool when preparing a nice warm meal for friends and loved ones.

So, how can crock pot cooking help beat the heat? To put it simply, the crock pot in and of itself puts off a lot less heat when cooking than an oven or stove . This is the very first and possibly the very best reason to utilize the crock pot in your summer meal planning. You should also consider the fact that by not heating the home by utilizing your stove or oven you are also preventing your air conditioning (or additional cooling methods) from working overtime to be able to compensate for the additional heat which other cooking systems pose.

This leaves crock pot cooking a win-win scenario as the costs involved with operating a crock pot are much less compared to the costs involved in operating a stove or oven in general. Whether electric or gas, your cooker and oven are often considerable energy hogs. Add to the fact that you're not increasing the temperature in your house by conventional way of cooking and you're using less power.

 The truth is that the crock pot should be one of your best loved and most often utilized cooking approaches in the event that you're able to manage it. In regards to cooking with a crock pot, the choices are nearly limitless.  



In addition to the cost benefits mentioned above when it comes to crock pot cooking there are many different benefits that are well worth mentioning. First of all, the majority of the work involved in crock pot cooking takes place early in the afternoon when you're refreshed rather than at the end of a hectic work or play day. This usually means that you are not as likely to forget an ingredient or make different mistakes that frequently occur as we hurriedly prepare a dinner once we are exhausted in the actions of our day.

Secondly, many good crock pot recipes incorporate the vegetables that insure we are getting the nutrients that we need. So often, when preparing a meal at the last moment, vegetables and other side dishes have been made in favor of expedience. Crock pot cooking many cases is a meal in 1 dish.

 Unlike vegetables and pans, most crock pot dishes are created in 1 dish. This usually means that there isn't going to be mountains of meals to be hand cleaned or packed to the dishwasher (or in case you are like me-both) later. You're able to spend less time cleaning only as you spent time slaving over a hot stove. Oh wait! Make that no time slaving over a hot stove. Once clean up is complete you can get back to enjoying the sun set, pursuing the lightening bugs with your little ones, or waiting for your first superstar.

While there'll be no 1 size fits all best cooking process, crock pot cooking comes very close. If you have a crock pot gathering dust somewhere at the back of your pantry it is the right time to get it out, dust if off, and dig some terrific summertime crock pot cooking recipes.
