Second, many good crock pot recipes incorporate the vegetables that guarantee we are getting the nutrients that we need. So often, when planning a meal at the last moment, vegetables and other side dishes are made in favor of expedience. Crock pot cooking in many instances is really a meal in 1 dish.

One other excellent reason to use a crock pot for the summertime cooking is that the ease of clean up.  Unlike pots and pans, many crock pot dishes are made in 1 dish. This means that there isn't going to be mountains of dishes to be either hand washed or packed to the dishwasher (or in case you're like me-both) later. You're able to spend less time cleaning just as you spent less time slaving over a hot stove. Oh wait! Make that no time slaving over a hot stove. Once tidy is complete you can get back to enjoying the sun set, pursuing the lightening bugs along with your small ones, or waiting for your very first superstar.

While there will never be a one size fits all very ideal cooking system, crock pot cooking comes very near. If you've got a crock pot collecting dust somewhere in the rear of your pantry it is time to get it out, dust off, and dig some terrific summer crock pot cooking recipes.
