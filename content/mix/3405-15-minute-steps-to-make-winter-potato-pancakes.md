Becoming A Healthy Eater

    
Camp cooking can be as complicated or simple as you want it to be. If you would like to prepare quick and easy but healthy meals while you're swimming, camp cooking doesn't even need to require a flame. However, if you are considering ridding your camping excursion with a feast, camp cooking can enable you to make warm, healthy foods which are as good as you can create them at home in your kitchen.

 Almost any cooking procedure you use in the kitchen can be duplicated around the home. For example, use a dutch oven or pit cooking to bake your food. You may also easily fry foods at a pan over a grill, or boil, braise and roast. Which kind of camping cookware is ideal for you? Camp cooking and clean-up can be easy or a hassle, and it all starts with great camping equipment.

Some pots/pans come in sets that mate collectively or"nest" for storage and even allow you to tuck a canister of gas within them. This also comes in handy once you're looking to save space whilst camping.

Following are some camping items to carry with you if you are considering preparing some meals around the home. These frequent kitchen items allow you to replicate yummy meals as you're out of doors.

• Salt and pepper
• Other of your favorite herbs and spices
• Cooking oil
• Pot holder

• Aluminum foil
• Tongs and spatula
• Cutting knives
• Cutting board
• Mixing bowl
• Paper or plastic silverware, plates and cups

If you have only a couple campers and are searching for some simple camp cooking, try out the simple and fast technique of tin could cooking. All you'll need is a fresh tin can -- a 1 gallon size may works well. Your source of heat can be a small campfire, or if wood burning is illegal, a little buddy burner may work well, which can be located at sporting good stores or online. Place your meal from the tin could and easily heat the contents of your can over a flame.  This technique works great for sauces, beans and tuna fish.

A more time-consuming camp cooking technique that also produces tasty meals is pit cooking. Pit cooking is great for items which may be wrapped in aluminum foil to be cooked.  It's also a great camp cooking system if you are using a dutch oven or cast iron cookware. Pit cooking warms your meals by heating rocks and coals that are buried in the floor. As the stones cool away, their emitted heat cooks the meals. To pit cookfirst dig a hole that is approximately three times bigger than your own cookware. Line the pit with rocks and build a fire in the center. Once the flame has burned rapidly for about one hour, push the warm coals and stone into the center. Twist your wrapped meals covered skillets in addition to the rocks and coals and place more on top. After a number of hours, you will have some delicious camp food to relish.
