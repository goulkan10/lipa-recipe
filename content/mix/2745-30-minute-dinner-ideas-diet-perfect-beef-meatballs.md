Boredom, or even to kill the time.

In your car

So that when you become hungry - you have them.

Evenings and mornings are busy intervals in many houses.
Making the time to eat can be hard, though you
Should not run out the door without eating breakfast
first. 
That a bagel is a excellent way to start the day.

Anytime you are on the go, always Make Certain That you
Make the ideal food decisions. 
Food with you in case you will need to, so you have it
When you require it. Eating healthy on the go is easy

I don&#39;t fry, b/c I am too impatient, and the meatballs break up more that way. I scoop them out with a spoon, roll them in my hands, and bake on a cake rack in the oven over a foil-lined cookie sheet. This way, they brown nicely, excess fat is drained off, and they can go right into sauce, or, in our family, meatball. For the meatballs; season the beef mince in a large bowl with two generous pinches of salt and pepper. Soak the bread slices in milk until fully absorbed then remove any excess milk by squeezing the bread with your hands.
