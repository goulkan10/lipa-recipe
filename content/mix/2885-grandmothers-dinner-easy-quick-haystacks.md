Becoming A Healthy Eater

    
Camp cooking can be as elaborate or simple as you would like it to be. If you wish to prepare quick and easy but healthy meals when you're swimming, camp cooking doesn't even need to require a flame. But if you are thinking about fueling your camping trip using a feast, then camp cooking can enable you to make hot, healthy foods which are as good as you can create them at home in your kitchen.

Camp cooking does not have to be limited to sandwiches and baked potatoes wrapped in aluminum foil.  Just about any cooking procedure you are using in the kitchen can be duplicated around the home. For instance, use a dutch oven or pit cooking to consume your meals. You may also easily fry foods at a pan over a grill, or boil, braise and roast. What type of camping cookware is best for you? Camp cooking and clean-up may be easy or a hassle, it all starts with great camping gear.

Some pots/pans come in places that partner together or"nest" for storage and even allow you to tuck a spoonful of fuel inside them. This really comes in handy when you're wanting to save room whilst camping.

Following are some camping things to take with you if you're considering preparing some meals around the campfire. These frequent kitchen items allow you to duplicate tasty meals while you're out of doorways.

• Salt and pepper
• Other of your favorite herbs and spices
• Cooking oil
• Pot holder

• Aluminum foil
• Tongs and spatula
• Cutting knives
• Cutting board
• Mixing bowl
• Paper or plastic silverware, plates and cups

If you have just a few campers and are searching for some very simple camp cooking, try the simple and quick technique of tin can cooking. All you will need is a fresh tin can -- a one gallon size may works well. Your source of warmth can be a little campfire, or if wood burning is illegal, a small buddy burner may work well, which may be found at sporting good stores or online. Put your meal from the tin could and simply warm the contents of your own can over a flame. You'll have a hot meal ready in seconds.  This technique works great for sauces, beans and poultry.

A more time-consuming camp cooking technique which also produces yummy meals is pit cooking.  It's also a excellent camp cooking system if you are using a dutch oven or cast iron cookware. Pit cooking warms your food by heating stones and coals which are buried in the floor. As the stones cool off, their emitted heat cooks the food. To pit cook, first dig a hole that is about three times bigger than your own cookware. Line the pit with rocks and create a fire in the middle. When the fire has burnt rapidly for approximately an hour, push the hot coals and stone into the middle. Layer your wrapped meals covered skillets on top of the stones and coals and place on top. After a couple of hours, you'll have some delicious camp food to enjoy.
