Getting A Healthy Eater

    
Camp cooking can be as elaborate or simple as you would like it to be. If you would like to prepare fast and easy but healthy meals when you're camping, camp cooking doesn't even have to require a flame. However, if you're interested in fueling your camping trip using a feast, camp cooking can make it possible for you to make warm, healthy foods which are as good as you can create them at home in your kitchen.

 Just about any cooking process you use in the kitchen could be duplicated around the campfire. For example, use a toaster or pit cooking to consume your meals. You might also easily fry foods at a pan over a grill, or boil, braise and roast. What type of camping cookware is best for you? Camp cooking and cleanup can be easy or a hassle, and it all starts with great camping gear.

Some pots/pans come in places that partner together or"nest" for storage and also let you tuck a canister of fuel inside them. This really comes in handy when you're searching to save room while camping.

Following are some camping items to consider with you if you're considering preparing some meals around the home. These common kitchen items allow you to duplicate tasty meals while you're out of doorways.


• Other of your favourite herbs and spices
• Cooking oil
• Pot holder

• Aluminum foil
• Tongs and spatula
• Cutting knives
• Cutting board
• Mixing bowl
• Paper or plastic silverware, plates and cups

In case you have just a couple campers and are looking for some very simple camp cooking, try out the simple and fast technique of tin could cooking. All you will need is a fresh tin can -- a 1 gallon size may works well. Your source of heat may be little campfire, or if wood burning is prohibited, a little buddy burner may work nicely, which can be located at sporting good stores or online. Put your meal in the tin can and simply warm the contents of your can over a fire.  This technique works great for sauces, beans and poultry.

A more time-consuming pub cooking technique which also produces tasty food is pit cooking.  It is also a wonderful camp cooking system if you are using a dutch oven or cast iron cookware. Pit cooking warms your food by heating rocks and coals that are buried in the ground. As the rocks cool away, their emitted heat cooks the food. To pit cookfirst dig a hole that's approximately three times larger than your cookware. Line the pit with rocks and create a fire in the middle. Once the fire has burned rapidly for approximately an hourpush the hot coals and stone into the center. Layer your wrapped meals covered skillets on top of the stones and coals and place more on top. Following a few hours, you will have some delicious camp food to enjoy.
