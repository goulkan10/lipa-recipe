This makes crock pot cooking a win-win scenario as the expenses involved in managing a crock pot are far less compared to the costs involved in managing a stove or oven in general. Whether electric or gas, your cooker and oven tend to be significant energy hogs.

Another wonderful reason to use a crock pot for your summer cooking is the ease of clean up.  Unlike pans and pans, most crock pot foods are created in one dish. This means that there will not be mountains of meals to be either hand washed or packed to the dishwasher (or if you are like me-both) afterwards. It is possible to spend less time cleaning just as you spent less time slaving over a hot cooker. Oh wait! Ensure time slaving over a hot stove. After clean up is complete you can contact enjoying the sun set, pursuing the lightening bugs along with your small ones, or waiting for your first celebrity.

While there'll be no one size fits all best cooking process, crock pot cooking comes really near. When you have a crock pot collecting dust somewhere at the rear of your pantry it's time to get out it, dust if off, and dig up some terrific summer crock pot cooking recipes.

The lobster roll is a sandwich that originated in New England. It&#39;s made of just a few ingredients: large chunks of lobster, butter, lemon juice, and mayonnaise, stuffed into a grilled hot dog bun. This lobster roll, on the other hand, is Connecticut style. That means absolutely no mayo in sight, just melted butter and some chives for freshness. We think this version really let&#39;s the lobster take center.
