Camp cooking doesn't have to be limited to sandwiches and baked potatoes wrapped in aluminum foil.  Just about any cooking method you use from the kitchen could be duplicated around the home. For instance, use a dutch oven or pit cooking to consume your food. You may also easily fry foods in a pan over a grill, or boil, braise and beverage. Which type of camping cookware is best for you? Camp cooking and clean-up may be easy or a hassle, it all starts with great camping equipment.
