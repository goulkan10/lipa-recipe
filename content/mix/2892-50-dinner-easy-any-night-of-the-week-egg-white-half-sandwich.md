<i>Before you jump to Egg white half sandwich recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about {<strong>The Simple Ways to Be Healthy</strong>.</i>
Getting A Healthy Eater

    
Camp cooking can be as elaborate or simple as you want it to be. If you wish to prepare quick and simple but healthy meals when you're camping, camp cooking doesn't even need to need a fire. But if you are interested in ridding your camping trip using a feast, then camp cooking can allow you to make warm, healthy foods that are as good as you can create them at home in your own kitchen.

 Almost any cooking process you use from the kitchen can be duplicated around the campfire. For instance, use a toaster or pit cooking to bake your meals. You might also easily bake foods in a pan over a grill, or boil, braise and roast. What kind of camping cookware is ideal for you? Camp cooking and cleanup can be easy or a hassle, and it all starts with great camping gear.

Some pots/pans come in sets that partner collectively or"nest" for storage and even allow you to tuck a canister of fuel inside them. This comes in handy once you're wanting to save space while camping.

Listed below are some camping things to take with you if you're planning on preparing some meals around the campfire. These common kitchen items allow you to duplicate tasty meals while you're out of doors.


• Other of your favorite herbs and spices
• Cooking oil
• Pot holder
• Hand-held can opener
• Aluminum foil
• Tongs and spatula
• Cutting knives
• Cutting board
• Mixing bowl
• Paper or plastic silverware, plates and cups

In case you have only a couple campers and are looking for some simple camp cooking, try the simple and quick technique of tin can cooking. All you will need is a clean tin can -- a one gallon size may works well. Your source of warmth can be a small campfire, or if wood burning is illegal, a little buddy burner will work well, which may be seen at sporting good stores or online. Put your meal from the tin can and simply warm the contents of your own can over a flame. You'll have a hot meal ready in minutes.  This technique works great for sauces, beans and poultry.

A more time-consuming pub cooking technique which also produces tasty meals is pit cooking.  It is also a wonderful camp cooking system if you are using a dutch oven or cast iron cookware. Pit cooking calms your food by heating stones and coals that are concealed in the floor. As the rocks cool , their emitted heat cooks the food. To pit cook, first dig a hole that is about three times larger than your cookware. Line the pit with rocks and build a fire in the middle. When the fire has burned rapidly for approximately an hourpush the warm coals and rocks into the middle. Layer your wrapped meals covered skillets in addition to the stones and coals and put more on top. Following a few hours, you'll have some delicious camp food to enjoy.


<i>We hope you got insight from reading it, now let's go back to egg white half sandwich recipe. You can cook egg white half sandwich using <strong>7</strong> ingredients and <strong>6</strong> steps. Here is how you cook that.
</i>

##### The ingredients needed to make Egg white half sandwich:

1. Provide 2 egg whites
1. Prepare 1 avocado
1. Prepare 1/2 tbsp olive oil
1. You need 1 pinch salt and pepper
1. Use 1/2 tbsp balsamic vinagreta
1. You need 2 tbsp goat chesse
1. Provide 1 white bread


##### Instructions to make Egg white half sandwich:

1. For the avocado: mix the avocado with vinagreta, olive oil and salt and pepper
1. Toast the bread
1. Add the goat chesse in the bread
1. Put the avocado after the goat chesse
1. Put the egg whites on top
1. Enjoy!!!


I only add one half of the egg, right in the middle (mainly because the sandwich bread I use isn&#39;t big. The egg white doesn&#39;t contribute much, if any flavor. (Remember its uses in cooking; you wouldn&#39;t say that a meringue or an angel food cake tastes &#34;eggy.&#34;) Add one egg white to the cocktail shaker. Add all other ingredients except ice, seal your shaker, and give a vigorous shake—bartenders call this step. Place the cheese between the bread at an angle so that the edges hangover the sides of the bread. Butter the outside of one bread slice with half the butter.
