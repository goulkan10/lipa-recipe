Becoming A Healthy Eater

    
Camp cooking can be as elaborate or simple as you want it to be. If you would like to prepare quick and easy but healthy meals as you are camping, camp cooking doesn't even have to require a fire. But if you're thinking about fueling your camping trip using a feast, camp cooking can make it possible for you to make hot, healthy foods that are as great as you can make them at home in your kitchen.

Camp cooking does not have to be limited to sandwiches and baked potatoes wrapped in aluminum foil.  Just about any cooking method you use from the kitchen can be duplicated around the campfire. For instance, use a dutch oven or pit cooking to bake your food. You might also easily bake foods at a pan over a grill, or boil, braise and beverage. Which type of camping cookware is best for you? Camp cooking and clean-up may be easy or a hassle, and it all starts with great camping gear.

Some pots/pans come in sets that partner together or"nest" for storage and also allow you to tuck a canister of fuel inside them. This comes in handy once you're seeking to save room while camping.

Following are some camping things to carry with you if you're planning on preparing some meals around the campfire. These frequent kitchen items allow you to duplicate tasty meals when you are out of doorways.

• Salt and pepper
• Other of your favourite herbs and spices
• Cooking oil
• Pot holder

• Aluminum foil
• Tongs and spatula
• Cutting knives
• Cutting board
• Mixing bowl
• Paper or plastic silverware, plates and cups

In case you have just a few campers and are looking for some easy camp cooking, try the simple and fast technique of tin could cooking. All you'll need is a fresh tin can -- a 1 gallon size may works well. Your source of warmth can be a little campfire, or when wood burning is prohibited, a little buddy burner will work well, which may be seen at sporting good stores or online. Place your meal in the tin could and simply warm the contents of your can over a flame. You will have a hot meal ready in seconds.  This technique works great for soups, beans and poultry.

A more time-consuming camp cooking technique that also produces delectable meals is pit cooking. Pit cooking is wonderful for items that could be wrapped in aluminum foil to be cooked.  It's also a excellent camp cooking method if you're using a dutch oven or cast iron cookware. Pit cooking calms your meals by heating stones and coals that are concealed in the floor. As the rocks cool away, their emitted heat cooks the food. To pit cookfirst dig a hole that is about three times larger than your own cookware. Line the pit with rocks and build a fire in the center. Once the flame has burnt rapidly for about an hourpush the hot coals and stones into the center. Layer your wrapped food covered skillets on top of the rocks and coals and place more on top. Following a few hours, you will have some delicious camp food to enjoy.
