Getting A Healthy Eater

    
Camp cooking can be as elaborate or simple as you want it to be. If you want to prepare fast and easy but nutritious meals when you are camping, camp cooking does not even need to need a flame. But if you are interested in fueling your camping trip having a feast, then camp cooking can allow you to earn hot, healthy foods that are as good as you can make them at home in your own kitchen.

Camp cooking doesn't need to be limited to sandwiches and baked potatoes wrapped in aluminum foil.  Almost any cooking process you are using in the kitchen can be duplicated around the home. For example, use a dutch oven or pit cooking to consume your meals. You might also easily fry foods in a bowl over a grill, or boil, braise and roast. What kind of camping cookware is ideal for you? Camp cooking and clean-up may be easy or a hassle, it all starts with great camping equipment.

Some pots/pans arrive in places that partner together or"nest" for storage and also let you tuck a canister of fuel inside them. This really comes in handy once you're trying to save space while camping.

Following are some camping things to carry with you if you're planning on preparing some meals around the campfire. These common kitchen items will allow you to duplicate tasty meals as you are out of doorways.

• Salt and pepper
• Other your favorite herbs and spices
• Cooking oil
• Pot holder
• Hand-held can opener
• Aluminum foil

• Cutting knives
• Cutting board
• Mixing bowl


In case you have just a few campers and are looking for some simple camp cooking, try the easy and speedy technique of tin could cooking. All you'll need is a clean tin can -- a one gallon size may works well. Your source of heat may be small campfire, or if wood burning is illegal, a little buddy burner may work nicely, which may be seen at sporting good stores or online. Put your meal in the tin can and just warm the contents of your can over a flame. You will have a hot meal ready in minutes.  This technique works great for sauces, beans and tuna fish.

A more time-consuming pub cooking technique which also produces delectable food is pit cooking. Pit cooking is very good for items that may be wrapped in aluminum foil to be cooked.  It's also a great camp cooking system if you are using a dutch oven or cast iron cookware. Pit cooking warms your meals by heating stones and coals that are buried in the ground. As the rocks cool off, their emitted heat cooks the meals. To pit cook, first dig a hole that's about three times larger than your own cookware. Line the pit with rocks and create a fire in the center. When the fire has burnt rapidly for approximately an hourpush the warm coals and stone into the middle. Twist your wrapped food or covered skillets on top of the rocks and coals and put more on top. After a number of hours, you'll have some delicious camp food to enjoy.
