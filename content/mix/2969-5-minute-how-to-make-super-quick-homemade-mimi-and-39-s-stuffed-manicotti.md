Camp cooking doesn't have to be limited to sandwiches and baked potatoes wrapped in aluminum foil.  Just about any cooking procedure you are using from the kitchen could be duplicated around the home. For instance, use a toaster or pit cooking to bake your meals. You could also easily fry foods in a bowl over a grill, or boil, braise and roast. What type of camping cookware is ideal for you? Camp cooking and cleanup can be easy or a hassle, it all starts with great camping equipment.

Line the pit with stones and construct a fire in the center. When the flame has burned rapidly for about one hour, push the hot coals and rocks into the middle. Twist your wrapped meals or covered skillets in addition to the stones and coals and put on top. After a few hours, you will have some delicious camp food to relish.
