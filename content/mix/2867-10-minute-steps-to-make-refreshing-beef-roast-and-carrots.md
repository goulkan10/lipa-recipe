Carrots, onions, and potatoes make this classic beef pot roast a hearty one-pot meal. After searing the beef and quickly sautéing the onions, the meat is slowly simmered on the stovetop. Toss in the veggies an hour before it&#39;s done so that the mean is perfectly tender and the vegetables aren&#39;t mushy. A simple homemade gravy is the perfect finishing touch. Drizzle the beef with oil and season well with sea salt and black pepper, then rub all over the meat.
