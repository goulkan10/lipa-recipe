Getting A Healthy Eater

    
Camp cooking can be as complicated or simple as you want it to be. If you would like to prepare fast and simple but nutritious meals while you're camping, camp cooking doesn't even need to need a flame. However, if you're thinking about fueling your camping trip having a feast, then camp cooking can make it possible for you to make hot, healthy foods that are as good as you can make them at home in your kitchen.

Camp cooking doesn't need to be limited to sandwiches and baked potatoes wrapped in aluminum foil.  Almost any cooking procedure you are using in the kitchen could be duplicated around the campfire. For instance, use a toaster or pit cooking to consume your food. You might also easily fry foods in a pan over a grill, or boil, braise and roast. Which type of camping cookware is best for you? Camp cooking and clean-up can be easy or a hassle, it all starts with great camping equipment.

Some pots/pans come in places that mate together or"nest" for storage and even let you tuck a canister of fuel inside them. This really comes in handy once you're wanting to save space whilst camping.

Following are some camping items to consider with you if you're considering preparing some meals around the campfire. These common kitchen items allow you to replicate yummy meals as you are out of doorways.


• Other of your favourite herbs and spices
• Cooking oil
• Pot holder

• Aluminum foil

• Cutting knives
• Cutting board
• Mixing bowl
• Paper or plastic silverware, plates and cups

In case you have only a few campers and are searching for some easy camp cooking, try the easy and quick technique of tin can cooking. All you'll need is a fresh tin can -- a one gallon size can works nicely. Your source of warmth may be little campfire, or if wood burning is illegal, a little buddy burner may work nicely, which can be found at sporting good stores or online. Put your meal in the tin could and simply heat the contents of your can over a fire. You'll have a hot meal ready in seconds.  This technique works great for sauces, beans and tuna fish.

A more time-consuming camp cooking technique which also produces tasty food is pit cooking.  It's also a wonderful camp cooking system if you are using a dutch oven or cast iron cookware. Pit cooking warms your food by heating stones and coals that are buried in the ground. As the stones cool off, their emitted heat cooks the food. To pit cookfirst dig a hole that's approximately three times larger than your own cookware. Line the pit with rocks and construct a fire in the center. Once the fire has burned rapidly for approximately one hour, push the warm coals and stones into the middle. Twist your wrapped meals or covered skillets on top of the rocks and coals and place more on top. Following a couple of hours, you will have some tasty camp food to relish.
