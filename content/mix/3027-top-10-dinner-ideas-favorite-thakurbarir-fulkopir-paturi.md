However, if you're thinking about fueling your camping trip with a feast, then camp cooking can enable you to earn warm, healthy foods which are as good as you can make them at home in your own kitchen.

Camp cooking doesn't need to be limited to sandwiches and baked potatoes wrapped in aluminum foil.  Just about any cooking process you are using in the kitchen could be replicated around the home. For example, use a dutch oven or pit cooking to bake your food. You may also easily bake foods at a bowl over a grill, or boil, braise and roast. Which type of camping cookware is ideal for you? Camp cooking and clean-up may be easy or a hassle, it all starts with great camping gear.

Pit cooking warms your meals by heating rocks and coals which are buried in the floor. As the stones cool off, their emitted heat cooks the meals. To pit cook, first dig a hole that is about three times larger than your own cookware. Line the pit with rocks and construct a fire in the center. When the fire has burnt rapidly for about one hourpush the hot coals and stone into the center. Twist your wrapped meals covered skillets in addition to the rocks and coals and put more on top. Following a couple of hours, you'll have some delicious camp food to enjoy.
