Secondly, many good crock pot recipes include the vegetables that insure we're getting the nutrients that we need. So often, when preparing a meal in the last minute, vegetables and other side dishes are made in favor of expedience. Crock pot cooking in many instances is really a meal in 1 dish.

One other great reason to use a crock pot for your summer cooking is that the ease of clean up.  Unlike vegetables and pans, most crock pot meals are created in one dish. This usually means that there will not be mountains of dishes to be hand cleaned or loaded into the dishwasher (or if you are like me-both) afterwards. It's possible to spend less time cleaning as you spent time slaving over a hot stove. Oh wait! Ensure no time slaving over a hot stove. Once tidy is complete you can get back to enjoying the sun set, chasing the lightening bugs along with your small ones, or even waiting for the first celebrity.

While there will never be a 1 size fits all best cooking process, crock pot cooking comes really near. In case you've got a crock pot gathering dust somewhere in the rear of your pantry it's time to get out it, dust if off, and dig some excellent summer crock pot cooking recipes.
