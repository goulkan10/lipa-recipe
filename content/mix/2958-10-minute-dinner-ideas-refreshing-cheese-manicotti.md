Camp cooking can be as complicated or simple as you would like it to be. If you wish to prepare fast and easy but healthy meals when you are camping, camp cooking doesn't even need to require a fire. However, if you're interested in fueling your camping excursion with a feast, camp cooking can allow you to make hot, healthy foods which are as good as you can create them at home in your own kitchen.

 Just about any cooking process you are using in the kitchen could be replicated around the campfire. For example, use a toaster or pit cooking to bake your food.
