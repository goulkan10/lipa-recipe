Secondly, many great crock pot recipes include the vegetables that guarantee we're getting the nutrients we need. So frequently, when planning a meal at the last minute, vegetables and other side dishes are left out in favor of expedience. Crock pot cooking in many cases is really a meal in one dish.

Another excellent reason to use a crock pot for the summertime cooking is the ease of clean up.  Unlike vegetables and pans, many crock pot dishes are created in 1 dish. This means that there is not going to be mountains of dishes to be hand cleaned or packed to the dishwasher (or if you are like me-both) later. It is possible to spend less time cleaning only as you spent time slaving over a hot cooker. Oh wait! Ensure time slaving over a hot cooker. Once clean up is complete you can get back to enjoying the sun set, chasing the lightening bugs with your little ones, or waiting for the very first superstar.

While there'll never be a 1 size fits all very ideal cooking process, crock pot cooking comes very near. If you have a crock pot collecting dust somewhere at the back of your pantry it's time to get it out, dust if off, and dig some amazing summer crock pot cooking recipes.
