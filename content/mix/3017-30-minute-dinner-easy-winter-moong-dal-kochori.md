Getting A Healthy Eater

    
Camp cooking can be as complicated or simple as you would like it to be. If you want to prepare quick and simple but nutritious meals when you are camping, camp cooking does not even have to require a fire. However, if you're thinking about fueling your camping excursion having a feast, then camp cooking can make it possible for you to make warm, healthy foods that are as good as you can create them at home in your kitchen.

Camp cooking does not need to be limited to sandwiches and baked potatoes wrapped in aluminum foil.  Almost any cooking system you are using in the kitchen could be replicated around the campfire. For example, use a toaster or pit cooking to consume your meals. You could also easily fry foods in a pan over a grill, or boil, braise and roast. What sort of camping cookware is best for you? Camp cooking and clean-up may be easy or a hassle, and it all starts with great camping gear.

Some pots/pans come in sets that mate together or"nest" for storage and also allow you to tuck a spoonful of fuel inside them. This also comes in handy when you're wanting to save room while camping.

Listed below are some camping things to carry with you if you're planning on preparing some meals around the home. These frequent kitchen items allow you to replicate yummy meals when you're out of doors.


• Other of your favorite herbs and spices
• Cooking oil
• Pot holder

• Aluminum foil

• Cutting knives
• Cutting board
• Mixing bowl
• Paper or plastic silverware, plates and cups

When you have only a few campers and are searching for some easy camp cooking, try out the simple and quick technique of tin can cooking. All you will need is a fresh tin can -- a one gallon size can works nicely. Your source of warmth can be a little campfire, or when wood burning is illegal, a little buddy burner will work well, which may be seen at sporting good stores or online. Place your meal from the tin can and just warm the contents of your own can over a fire.  This technique works great for sauces, beans and poultry.

A more time-consuming pub cooking technique that also produces yummy food is pit cooking. Pit cooking is terrific for items which could be wrapped in aluminum foil to be cooked.  It's also a great camp cooking system if you are using a dutch oven or cast iron cookware. Pit cooking warms your meals by heating stones and coals that are concealed in the floor. As the rocks cool , their emitted heat cooks the food. To pit cookfirst dig a hole that's about three times larger than your own cookware. Line the pit with stones and build a fire in the center. Once the flame has burned rapidly for approximately one hour, push the warm coals and stones into the center. Twist your wrapped meals covered skillets on top of the stones and coals and place more on top. After a couple of hours, you will have some delicious camp food to enjoy.
