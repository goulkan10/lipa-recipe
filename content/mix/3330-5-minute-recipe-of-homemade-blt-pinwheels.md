Becoming A Healthy Eater

    
Camp cooking can be as complicated or simple as you want it to be. If you would like to prepare quick and easy but nutritious meals while you're camping, camp cooking doesn't even have to require a flame. But if you are interested in ridding your camping trip with a feast, then camp cooking can enable you to earn warm, healthy foods that are as good as you can make them at home in your own kitchen.

 Just about any cooking method you are using from the kitchen can be duplicated around the campfire. For instance, use a toaster or pit cooking to bake your food. You may also easily bake foods in a pan over a grill, or boil, braise and beverage. What kind of camping cookware is best for you? Camp cooking and clean-up can be easy or a hassle, it all starts with great camping gear.

Some pots/pans come in sets that mate jointly or"nest" for storage and also let you tuck a canister of gas within them. This comes in handy when you're trying to save space while camping.

Following are some camping items to take with you if you're considering preparing some meals around the home. These frequent kitchen items will allow you to replicate yummy meals when you are out of doorways.


• Other of your favorite herbs and spices
• Cooking oil
• Pot holder
• Hand-held can opener
• Aluminum foil
• Tongs and spatula
• Cutting knives
• Cutting board
• Mixing bowl


In case you have just a few campers and are searching for some very simple camp cooking, try out the simple and fast technique of tin can cooking. All you'll need is a clean tin can -- a one gallon size may works nicely. Your source of warmth can be a small campfire, or when wood burning is prohibited, a little buddy burner may work nicely, which can be found at sporting good stores or online. Place your meal from the tin can and just heat the contents of your own can over a fire.  This technique works great for sauces, beans and tuna fish.

A more time-consuming pub cooking technique which also produces yummy food is pit cooking.  It's also a wonderful camp cooking system if you are using a dutch oven or cast iron cookware. Pit cooking warms your food by heating rocks and coals that are buried in the floor. As the stones cool away, their emitted heat cooks the meals. To pit cook, first dig a hole that's about three times bigger than your own cookware. Line the pit with stones and construct a fire in the middle. Once the flame has burnt rapidly for approximately an hourpush the hot coals and stones into the center. Layer your wrapped food or covered skillets in addition to the stones and coals and place on top. Following a couple of hours, you'll have some tasty camp food to relish.
