Getting A Healthy Eater

    
Camp cooking can be as elaborate or simple as you would like it to be. If you would like to prepare quick and simple but healthy meals while you are camping, camp cooking doesn't even need to need a fire. But if you are thinking about fueling your camping trip using a feast, camp cooking can make it possible for you to make warm, healthy foods which are as good as you can create them at home in your kitchen.

Camp cooking does not have to be limited to sandwiches and baked potatoes wrapped in aluminum foil.  Almost any cooking procedure you use in the kitchen could be replicated around the campfire. For example, use a dutch oven or pit cooking to consume your meals. You might also easily fry foods in a bowl over a grill, or boil, braise and roast. Which kind of camping cookware is best for you? Camp cooking and clean-up can be easy or a hassle, but it all starts with great camping equipment.

Some pots/pans arrive in places that mate together or"nest" for storage and even allow you to tuck a canister of gas within them. This really also comes in handy when you're looking to save room while camping.

Following are some camping items to take with you if you're considering preparing some meals around the campfire. These frequent kitchen items will allow you to replicate yummy meals while you're out of doors.


• Other your favorite herbs and spices
• Cooking oil
• Pot holder
• Hand-held can opener
• Aluminum foil

• Cutting knives
• Cutting board
• Mixing bowl
• Paper or plastic silverware, plates and cups

When you have just a few campers and are searching for some easy camp cooking, try the easy and fast technique of tin could cooking. All you'll need is a fresh tin can -- a one gallon size may works well. Your source of heat may be little campfire, or if wood burning is prohibited, a little buddy burner will work nicely, which may be located at sporting good stores or online. Put your meal in the tin could and easily heat the contents of your own can over a fire. You will have a hot meal ready in seconds.  This technique works great for soups, beans and poultry.

A more time-consuming pub cooking technique that also produces yummy meals is pit cooking.  It's also a wonderful camp cooking method if you're using a dutch oven or cast iron cookware. Pit cooking calms your meals by heating rocks and coals which are buried in the floor. As the stones cool away, their emitted heat cooks the meals. To pit cook, first dig a hole that is approximately three times bigger than your own cookware. Line the pit with stones and build a fire in the center. When the flame has burnt rapidly for approximately an hourpush the hot coals and rocks into the center. Layer your wrapped meals covered skillets in addition to the stones and coals and place on top. After a couple of hours, you will have some delicious camp food to relish.
