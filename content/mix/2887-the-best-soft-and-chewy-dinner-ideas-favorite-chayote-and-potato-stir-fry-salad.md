Another excellent reason to use a crock pot for the summertime cooking is the ease of clean up.  Unlike pans and pans, most crock pot meals are created in 1 dish. This usually means that there is not going to be mountains of meals to be either hand washed or packed into the dishwasher (or in case you are like me-both) afterwards. You're able to spend less time cleaning as you spent time slaving over a hot cooker. Oh wait! Ensure no time slaving over a hot stove. Once tidy is complete you can contact enjoying the sun set, chasing the lightening bugs with your little ones, or waiting for the very first celebrity.
