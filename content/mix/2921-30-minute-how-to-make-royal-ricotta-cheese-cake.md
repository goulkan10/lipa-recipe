This usually means that there won't be mountains of meals to be hand washed or loaded to the dishwasher (or if you are like me-both) afterwards. You can spend less time cleaning just as you spent less time slaving over a hot cooker. Oh wait! Ensure no time slaving over a hot cooker. Once clean up is complete you can get back to enjoying the sun set, chasing the lightening bugs along with your little ones, or even waiting for your very first celebrity.

While there will never be a one size fits all ideal cooking process, crock pot cooking comes very close. In case you've got a crock pot collecting dust somewhere in the rear of your pantry it's the right time to get out it, dust in the off, and dig up some fantastic summertime crock pot cooking recipes.
