<i>Before you jump to Chinese Beef Chow Mein recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about {<strong>The Simple Ways to Be Healthy</strong>.</i>
Becoming A Healthy Eater

    
Camp cooking can be as complicated or simple as you would like it to be. If you wish to prepare fast and easy but healthy meals while you are camping, camp cooking doesn't even need to need a flame. However, if you're interested in ridding your camping excursion with a feast, then camp cooking can allow you to make hot, healthy foods that are as great as you can create them at home in your kitchen.

 Almost any cooking method you are using in the kitchen can be duplicated around the campfire. For example, use a toaster or pit cooking to bake your food. You could also easily fry foods at a pan over a grill, or boil, braise and roast. What kind of camping cookware is ideal for you? Camp cooking and cleanup can be easy or a hassle, but it all starts with great camping gear.

Some pots/pans come in sets that mate jointly or"nest" for storage and even allow you to tuck a spoonful of gas within them. This comes in handy once you're searching to save room whilst camping.

Listed below are some camping things to carry with you if you're considering preparing some meals around the home. These common kitchen items will allow you to duplicate tasty meals when you're out of doors.

• Salt and pepper
• Other of your favourite herbs and spices
• Cooking oil
• Pot holder

• Aluminum foil
• Tongs and spatula
• Cutting knives
• Cutting board
• Mixing bowl


If you have only a couple campers and are searching for some very simple camp cooking, try out the easy and fast technique of tin can cooking. All you'll need is a fresh tin can -- a one gallon size can works nicely. Your source of heat can be a small campfire, or if wood burning is illegal, a small buddy burner will work well, which may be seen at sporting good stores or online. Put your meal from the tin can and simply heat the contents of your own can over a fire.  This technique works great for soups, beans and tuna fish.

A more time-consuming camp cooking technique which also produces delectable food is pit cooking. Pit cooking is very good for items which could be wrapped in aluminum foil to be cooked.  It's also a excellent camp cooking method if you're using a dutch oven or cast iron cookware. Pit cooking calms your meals by heating rocks and coals that are concealed in the floor. As the stones cool away, their emitted heat cooks the food. To pit cook, first dig a hole that is roughly three times bigger than your cookware. Line the pit with rocks and create a fire in the middle. When the flame has burnt rapidly for about an hourpush the hot coals and stones into the middle. Twist your wrapped meals or covered skillets in addition to the rocks and coals and put on top. After a number of hours, you'll have some tasty camp food to relish.
