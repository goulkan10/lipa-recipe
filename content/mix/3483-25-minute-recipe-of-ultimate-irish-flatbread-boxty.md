So, how can crock pot cooking help overcome the heat? In other words, the crock pot in and of itself puts off much less heat when cooking compared to an oven or stove top. Here is the first and maybe the best reason to use the crock pot on summer time meal preparation. You should also consider the fact that by not heating your house by utilizing your stove or oven you're also avoiding your air conditioning (or alternative cooling systems ) from working overtime so as to compensate for the extra heat that other cooking methods pose.

This makes crock pot cooking a win-win situation as the costs involved in managing a crock pot are much less than the expenses related to operating a stove or oven generally. Whether gas or electric, your cooker and oven are often significant energy hogs.

Second, many great crock pot recipes incorporate the vegetables that guarantee we are getting the nutrients that we need. So frequently, when preparing a meal in the last minute, vegetables and other side dishes have been left out in favor of expedience. Crock pot cooking in many cases is a meal in one dish.

 Unlike pots and pans, many crock pot meals are made in 1 dish. This usually means that there will not be mountains of dishes to be hand cleaned or loaded to the dishwasher (or in case you're like me-both) afterwards. You can spend less time cleaning just as you spent time slaving over a hot cooker. Oh wait! Ensure no time slaving over a hot cooker. After tidy is complete you can get back to enjoying the sunshine set, pursuing the lightening bugs along with your little ones, or waiting for your very first superstar.
