This means that there will not be mountains of dishes to be hand washed or loaded into the dishwasher (or in case you're like me-both) later. You can spend less time cleaning just as you spent less time slaving over a hot cooker. Oh wait! Make that no time slaving over a hot cooker. After clean up is complete you can get back to enjoying the sunshine set, pursuing the lightening bugs with your small ones, or waiting for your first superstar.
