<i>Before you jump to Toffee Apple Crumble Cake recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about {<strong>The Simple Ways to Be Healthy</strong>.</i>
Becoming A Healthy Eater

    
Camp cooking can be as complicated or simple as you would like it to be. If you want to prepare quick and simple but healthy meals when you are camping, camp cooking does not even need to need a flame. But if you're interested in ridding your camping trip using a feast, then camp cooking can enable you to make warm, healthy foods which are as good as you can make them at home in your kitchen.

 Just about any cooking procedure you are using from the kitchen could be duplicated around the home. For example, use a dutch oven or pit cooking to bake your meals. You can also easily bake foods in a pan over a grill, or boil, braise and beverage. Which type of camping cookware is ideal for you? Camp cooking and cleanup can be easy or a hassle, and it all starts with great camping equipment.

Some pots/pans arrive in sets that partner together or"nest" for storage and even allow you to tuck a spoonful of gas within them. This really also comes in handy once you're searching to save space while camping.

Listed below are some camping items to carry with you if you are planning on preparing some meals around the home. These common kitchen items allow you to duplicate tasty meals when you are out of doors.


• Other your favourite herbs and spices
• Cooking oil
• Pot holder
• Hand-held can opener
• Aluminum foil

• Cutting knives
• Cutting board
• Mixing bowl


When you have just a few campers and are looking for some simple camp cooking, try the easy and quick technique of tin can cooking. All you'll need is a clean tin can -- a 1 gallon size can works well. Your source of warmth can be a little campfire, or when wood burning is illegal, a little buddy burner may work nicely, which can be located at sporting good stores or online. Put your meal in the tin can and easily warm the contents of your can over a fire.  This technique works great for sauces, beans and tuna fish.

A more time-consuming camp cooking technique which also produces delectable meals is pit cooking. Pit cooking is great for items which may be wrapped in aluminum foil to be cooked.  It is also a wonderful camp cooking method if you are using a dutch oven or cast iron cookware. Pit cooking warms your food by heating stones and coals which are concealed in the ground. As the stones cool , their emitted heat cooks the meals. To pit cook, first dig a hole that's about three times bigger than your own cookware. Line the pit with rocks and construct a fire in the center. Once the fire has burned rapidly for about one hour, push the warm coals and stone into the center. Layer your wrapped food or covered skillets in addition to the rocks and coals and place more on top. After a couple of hours, you will have some delicious camp food to enjoy.

Toffee apple crumble is as good as it sounds. Tart apples, creamy sweet toffee sauce and a perfectly crunchy crumble topping. The filling is made with crisp Bramley apples and sweet dates in an indulgent caramel. Bramley apples are perfect for this recipe because they have a higher malic acid content. Apple Toffee Crunch Cake - fresh apple cake with crunchy pecans, cinnamon buttercream and a toffee sauce drip.
