<i>Before you jump to Potato-Apple Cheddar Pancakes recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about {<strong>The Basics of Being Healthy</strong>.</i>
Getting A Healthy Eater

    
Camp cooking can be as complicated or simple as you would like it to be. If you would like to prepare fast and easy but nutritious meals while you're camping, camp cooking doesn't even need to need a fire. However, if you are considering fueling your camping excursion using a feast, then camp cooking can allow you to make hot, healthy foods which are as great as you can create them at home in your own kitchen.

Camp cooking does not need to be limited to sandwiches and baked potatoes wrapped in aluminum foil.  Just about any cooking process you are using from the kitchen can be duplicated around the campfire. For instance, use a toaster or pit cooking to bake your food. You may also easily fry foods at a bowl over a grill, or boil, braise and roast. What type of camping cookware is best for you? Camp cooking and clean-up may be easy or a hassle, but it all starts with great camping equipment.

Some pots/pans arrive in places that partner together or"nest" for storage and also let you tuck a spoonful of gas within them. This comes in handy once you're seeking to save room while camping.

Listed below are some camping items to consider with you if you are considering preparing some meals around the campfire. These common kitchen items allow you to duplicate tasty meals as you are out of doors.

• Salt and pepper
• Other your favourite herbs and spices
• Cooking oil
• Pot holder

• Aluminum foil

• Cutting knives
• Cutting board
• Mixing bowl
• Paper or plastic silverware, plates and cups

In case you have just a couple campers and are searching for some simple camp cooking, try out the easy and fast technique of tin may cooking. All you'll need is a fresh tin can -- a 1 gallon size can works nicely. Your source of heat can be a little campfire, or if wood burning is prohibited, a small buddy burner may work nicely, which can be seen at sporting good stores or online. Place your meal in the tin can and simply heat the contents of your own can over a fire.  This technique works great for soups, beans and poultry.

A more time-consuming camp cooking technique that also produces tasty food is pit cooking.  It is also a great camp cooking method if you're using a dutch oven or cast iron cookware. Pit cooking calms your meals by heating stones and coals that are concealed in the floor. As the stones cool , their emitted heat cooks the meals. To pit cook, first dig a hole that is about three times bigger than your cookware. Line the pit with stones and construct a fire in the middle. Once the fire has burned rapidly for about an hour, push the hot coals and stones into the center. Twist your wrapped food or covered skillets on top of the stones and coals and put more on top. After a few hours, you'll have some tasty camp food to relish.

I am not one to resist potatoes, especially when they call out my name. So yesterday, I mixed up a batch of these Savory Apple Potato Pancakes with some thyme and green chilies. They were so good, I ate up the first batch hot off the stove, and it took all of my willpower to save some for Jay. Don&#39;t tell the kids that these fruity, tasty pancakes have sweet potatoes in them to make them nutritious. Autumn apple picking yields plenty of harvest for apple potato pancakes ñ warm, crispy treats that are perfect for fall!
