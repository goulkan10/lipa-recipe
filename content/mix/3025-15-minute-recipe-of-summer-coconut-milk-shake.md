Becoming A Healthy Eater


When the weather warms up, the kitchen may be a terrible place to be. There are numerous things that you can do however, when it comes to cooking a great homemade meal that doesn't require traditional stove top or oven cooking. Learn how to utilize some of those lesser heat producing equipment in your own kitchen, such as the crock pot, in order to truly beat the summer heat and maintain your cool when preparing a great warm meal for friends and family.

So, how does crock pot cooking really help beat the heat? In other words, that the crock pot in and of itself puts off a lot less heat when cooking than the oven or stove . This is the very first and possibly the best reason to use the crock pot in summer time meal preparation. You should also look at the fact that by not heating your house by using your stove top or oven you're also avoiding your air conditioning (or additional cooling methods) from working overtime to be able to compensate for the extra heat that other cooking systems pose.

This makes crock pot cooking a win-win scenario since the expenses involved with managing a crock pot are far less than the expenses related to operating a cooker or stove in general. Whether electric or gas, your cooker and oven tend to be significant energy hogs. Add to that the fact that you're not increasing the warmth in your home by conventional means of cooking and you're using less power.

Unfortunately for most, the general consensus has been that crock pots were meant for comfort foods and hearty winter foods.  The truth is that the crock pot should be one of the best loved and most often utilized cooking methods in the event that you're able to handle it. When it comes to cooking with a crock pot, the options are nearly limitless.  Almost anything that can be baked can be created in the crock pot and many, many more wonderful and enticing meals and treats too.

Advantages of Crock Pot Cooking

Along with the cost advantages mentioned above as it pertains to crock pot cooking there are many other benefits which are well worth mentioning. First of all, the majority of the work involved in crock pot cooking occurs early in the day when you're refreshed rather than at the conclusion of a hectic work or play day. This means that you are less likely to forget a component or make different mistakes that often happen as we prepare a dinner when we are tired in the activities of our day.

Secondly, many great crock pot recipes incorporate the vegetables that insure we are getting the nutrients we need. So often, when preparing a meal in the last minute, vegetables and other side dishes are made in favour of expedience. Crock pot cooking in many instances is really a meal in 1 dish.

 Unlike pans and pans, many crock pot dishes are made in one dish. This means that there isn't going to be mountains of dishes to be hand washed or packed into the dishwasher (or if you are like me-both) later. It is possible to spend less time cleaning as you spent time slaving over a hot stove. Oh wait! Ensure no time slaving over a hot stove. Once clean up is complete you can get back to enjoying the sunshine set, pursuing the lightening bugs along with your little ones, or waiting for your very first star.

While there'll never be a 1 size fits all best cooking method, crock pot cooking comes really close. When you have a crock pot collecting dust somewhere at the back of your pantry it is time to get out it, dust off, and dig up some terrific summer crock pot cooking recipes.
