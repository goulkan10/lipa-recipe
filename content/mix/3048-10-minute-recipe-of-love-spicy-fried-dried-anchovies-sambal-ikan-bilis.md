Becoming A Healthy Eater

    
Camp cooking can be as elaborate or simple as you want it to be. If you want to prepare quick and easy but healthy meals when you're swimming, camp cooking doesn't even have to require a flame. However, if you're interested in ridding your camping excursion with a feast, then camp cooking can allow you to make warm, healthy foods that are as great as you can make them at home in your kitchen.

Camp cooking doesn't need to be limited to sandwiches and baked potatoes wrapped in aluminum foil.  Almost any cooking system you are using in the kitchen could be duplicated around the home. For instance, use a toaster or pit cooking to consume your food. You might also easily fry foods at a pan over a grill, or boil, braise and beverage. What sort of camping cookware is ideal for you? Camp cooking and clean-up can be easy or a hassle, but it all starts with great camping equipment.

Some pots/pans come in sets that mate collectively or"nest" for storage and also allow you to tuck a spoonful of fuel inside them. This comes in handy once you're seeking to save space while camping.

Following are some camping things to consider with you if you are thinking about preparing some meals around the home. These common kitchen items will allow you to duplicate tasty meals as you are out of doorways.


• Other of your favourite herbs and spices
• Cooking oil
• Pot holder
• Hand-held can opener
• Aluminum foil
• Tongs and spatula
• Cutting knives
• Cutting board
• Mixing bowl
• Paper or plastic silverware, plates and cups

If you have only a couple of campers and are looking for some very easy camp cooking, try out the simple and fast technique of tin can cooking. All you will need is a clean tin can -- a 1 gallon size may works nicely. Your source of heat can be a small campfire, or if wood burning is prohibited, a little buddy burner may work nicely, which can be seen at sporting good stores or online. Place your meal in the tin can and simply warm the contents of your own can over a fire. You'll have a hot meal ready in minutes.  This technique works great for sauces, beans and poultry.

A more time-consuming pub cooking technique which also produces tasty meals is pit cooking. Pit cooking is excellent for items that may be wrapped in aluminum foil to be cooked.  It is also a wonderful camp cooking method if you're using a dutch oven or cast iron cookware. Pit cooking calms your meals by heating rocks and coals which are concealed in the floor. As the rocks cool , their emitted heat cooks the meals. To pit cook, first dig a hole that is approximately three times bigger than your own cookware. Line the pit with stones and construct a fire in the middle. Once the flame has burned rapidly for about one hourpush the hot coals and rocks into the middle. Twist your wrapped meals or covered skillets on top of the rocks and coals and put more on top. Following a number of hours, you'll have some tasty camp food to relish.
