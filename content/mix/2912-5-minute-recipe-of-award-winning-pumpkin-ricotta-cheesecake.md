This usually means that there is not going to be mountains of meals to be either hand cleaned or packed into the dishwasher (or in case you are like me-both) later. It's possible to spend less time cleaning just as you spent time slaving over a hot stove. Oh wait! Ensure time slaving over a hot cooker. Once tidy is complete you can contact enjoying the sunshine set, chasing the lightening bugs with your small ones, or even waiting for your first superstar.

Ricotta Cheesecake is much lighter and fluffier than a traditional cheesecake , but still nice and creamy. The cake comes together quickly and can even be made in your food processor, which will. This is an authentic Italian cheesecake recipe handed down through generations. I decided to make this cheesecake because it&#39;s true Italian with the use of Ricotta. Combine pumpkin, ricotta cheese, maple syrup, cinnamon, vanilla extract, nutmeg, and salt in a small bowl; whip until fluffy and all.
