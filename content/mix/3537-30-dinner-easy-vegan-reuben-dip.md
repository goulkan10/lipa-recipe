Becoming A Healthy Eater

    
Camp cooking can be as elaborate or simple as you would like it to be. If you would like to prepare quick and easy but nutritious meals as you are camping, camp cooking does not even have to need a flame. But if you're interested in ridding your camping trip with a feast, camp cooking can allow you to make hot, healthy foods that are as good as you can create them at home in your kitchen.

 Almost any cooking procedure you use in the kitchen could be duplicated around the campfire. For instance, use a toaster or pit cooking to bake your food. You might also easily fry foods at a pan over a grill, or boil, braise and roast. Which type of camping cookware is best for you? Camp cooking and clean-up can be easy or a hassle, and it all starts with great camping gear.

Some pots/pans come in places that mate together or"nest" for storage and even let you tuck a spoonful of fuel inside them. This comes in handy when you're seeking to save room while camping.

Following are some camping items to carry with you if you are planning on preparing some meals around the home. These common kitchen items will allow you to duplicate tasty meals while you are out of doorways.


• Other your favourite herbs and spices
• Cooking oil
• Pot holder
• Hand-held can opener
• Aluminum foil
• Tongs and spatula
• Cutting knives
• Cutting board
• Mixing bowl


If you have just a couple campers and are looking for some simple camp cooking, try the simple and quick technique of tin can cooking. All you'll need is a fresh tin can -- a one gallon size may works nicely. Your source of heat may be little campfire, or if wood burning is illegal, a little buddy burner will work well, which can be seen at sporting good stores or online. Place your meal in the tin could and easily heat the contents of your own can over a flame. You'll have a hot meal ready in seconds.  This technique works great for sauces, beans and poultry.

A more time-consuming camp cooking technique that also produces yummy meals is pit cooking.  It's also a great camp cooking system if you are using a dutch oven or cast iron cookware. Pit cooking warms your food by heating rocks and coals which are concealed in the ground. As the stones cool away, their emitted heat cooks the food. To pit cookfirst dig a hole that's approximately three times larger than your own cookware. Line the pit with stones and build a fire in the center. Once the fire has burned rapidly for about one hourpush the hot coals and stone into the center. Layer your wrapped food or covered skillets in addition to the stones and coals and put more on top. Following a couple of hours, you'll have some tasty camp food to relish.
