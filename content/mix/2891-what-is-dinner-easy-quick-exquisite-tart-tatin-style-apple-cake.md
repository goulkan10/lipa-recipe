recipeingredient:
- "1 medium to large  Apples"
- "10 grams Butter to coat the mold"
- " Caramel sauce"
- "50 grams  Sugar"
- "1 generous  tablespoon  Water"
- " Cake batter"
- "70 grams Almond powder"
- "60 grams Sugar"
- "1 Egg separate the yolk and white"
- "1 tbsp Apricot jam"
- "1/2 tsp Lemon juice"
- "20 grams Cake flour"
- "1/4 tsp Baking powder"
- "40 grams Melted butter"
recipeinstructions:
- "First, make the caramel sauce. Put the caramel sauce ingredients in a pot, heat on medium, melt the sugar and slowly simmer until golden brown. Turn off the heat, then place pot on a damp towel, allow to cool to harden the caramel."
- "While waiting for the caramel to harden, prepare the apples and preheat the oven. Peel the apples, cut in half, core, then thinly slice into 2 to 3 mm wedges. Preheat the oven to 250°C."
- "After the caramel hardens, coat the caramel surface and the sides of the pot in butter. Since the butter and caramel will melt when baking, don&#39;t be concerned if they are lumpy. I recommend using your fingers to spread the butter after measuring it out."
- "Line the surface of the caramel with the sliced apples. After placing 2 or 3 end slices, lay the rest of the slices around in a circle while overlapping them. (Arranging the slices nicely will give the cake a pretty finish, but for those who don&#39;t mind, just lay the pieces flat.)"
- "Put the pot in the oven preheated to 250°C and bake for 12 minutes. If you have space on top of the oven (outside the oven), put the butter for the batter in a heat-resistant dish and simply let the butter melt in residual heat from the oven."
- "While baking the apples, let&#39;s make the batter! Put the almond powder, sugar, and egg white in a bowl, thoroughly mix together with a rubber spatula, then add the egg  yolk, apricot jam, and lemon juice, then thoroughly mix to incorporate air."
- "The apples should be done. Remove the pot from the oven, gently tip the pot, then pour out the juice from the baked apples into a separate dish to adjust the water content. Keep the leftover juices as it&#39;ll be used later."
- "After adjusting the water content, re-position the apple slices in the pot. If there are any gaps or if the apples are not lying flat, use a spoon to  press flat."
- "Set the oven to 200°C. For the batter, sprinkle the butter into the batter from Step 6, mix until smooth, then pour in the leftover apple juices and stir."
- "Combine the cake flour and baking powder and sift into the bowl, then, with a rubber spatula, fold in with cutting motions without kneading. Thoroughly mix until the batter becomes shiny. (With the rubber spatula, repeatedly trace a &#34;J&#34; on the bottom of the pan while turning the bowl towards you.)"
- "Pour the batter into the pot, then level it out. Bake for 8 minutes in an oven preheated to 200°C, reset oven to 180°C, then bake for 12 minutes, then reset oven to 170°C and bake for 3 more minutes."
- "It should look like this fresh from the oven. Pierce it with a skewer, and if it comes out clean, it&#39;s finished! Place a sheet of aluminum foil over the pot, and let&#39;s wait for the cake to cool. (If overbaked, the cake will be crumbly and dry)."
- "When the cake cools, with the aluminum foil in place, firmly hold the pot, and lightly agitate (give it a good, hard shake to dislodge the contents.) The caramelized apples should separate from the pot, and the cake should come out easily."
- "If the cake doesn&#39;t want to come out, or if the caramel has hardened and the cake won&#39;t budge, heat the pot over the stove and it should come right out. If you force it, the apples will end up a tragic mess, so be careful when removing the cake!"
- "Remove the aluminum foil, hold the pot over a dish one size larger than the pot, then carefully flip the pot over."
- "It should look like this."
- "Slice into desired size pieces and serve."

<i>Before you jump to Exquisite Tart Tatin-style Apple Cake recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about {<strong>The Simple Ways to Be Healthy</strong>.</i>
Getting A Healthy Eater

    
Camp cooking can be as elaborate or simple as you would like it to be. If you want to prepare quick and easy but healthy meals when you are camping, camp cooking does not even need to require a fire. However, if you are considering ridding your camping excursion using a feast, camp cooking can enable you to make hot, healthy foods which are as great as you can make them at home in your kitchen.

Camp cooking doesn't have to be limited to sandwiches and baked potatoes wrapped in aluminum foil.  Almost any cooking method you are using in the kitchen can be replicated around the campfire. For instance, use a toaster or pit cooking to consume your food. You may also easily bake foods at a bowl over a grill, or boil, braise and roast. What sort of camping cookware is ideal for you? Camp cooking and clean-up can be easy or a hassle, but it all starts with great camping gear.

Some pots/pans come in places that mate together or"nest" for storage and also allow you to tuck a canister of gas within them. This really comes in handy when you're wanting to save room while camping.

Following are some camping things to consider with you if you're considering preparing some meals around the campfire. These frequent kitchen items allow you to replicate yummy meals while you're out of doors.

• Salt and pepper
• Other of your favourite herbs and spices
• Cooking oil
• Pot holder

• Aluminum foil

• Cutting knives
• Cutting board
• Mixing bowl
• Paper or plastic silverware, plates and cups

If you have just a few campers and are searching for some very simple camp cooking, try out the simple and speedy technique of tin can cooking. All you will need is a fresh tin can -- a one gallon size can works nicely. Your source of warmth can be a little campfire, or if wood burning is illegal, a little buddy burner may work well, which may be found at sporting good stores or online. Put your meal from the tin could and easily heat the contents of your own can over a fire.  This technique works great for soups, beans and poultry.

A more time-consuming camp cooking technique which also produces tasty meals is pit cooking.  It is also a excellent camp cooking system if you're using a dutch oven or cast iron cookware. Pit cooking warms your meals by heating rocks and coals which are buried in the floor. As the stones cool away, their emitted heat cooks the meals. To pit cookfirst dig a hole that's approximately three times bigger than your cookware. Line the pit with rocks and build a fire in the center. Once the flame has burnt rapidly for about one hour, push the hot coals and stone into the middle. Twist your wrapped meals or covered skillets in addition to the stones and coals and place on top. Following a couple of hours, you'll have some delicious camp food to relish.

1. You need 1 generous  tablespoon ★ Water
1. Get  Cake batter
1. Prepare 70 grams Almond powder

1. You need 1/2 tsp Lemon juice
1. You need 20 grams Cake flour
1. Get 1/4 tsp Baking powder
1. You need 40 grams Melted butter


##### Steps to make Exquisite Tart Tatin-style Apple Cake:

1. First, make the caramel sauce. Put the caramel sauce ingredients in a pot, heat on medium, melt the sugar and slowly simmer until golden brown. Turn off the heat, then place pot on a damp towel, allow to cool to harden the caramel.
1. While waiting for the caramel to harden, prepare the apples and preheat the oven. Peel the apples, cut in half, core, then thinly slice into 2 to 3 mm wedges. Preheat the oven to 250°C.
1. After the caramel hardens, coat the caramel surface and the sides of the pot in butter. Since the butter and caramel will melt when baking, don&#39;t be concerned if they are lumpy. I recommend using your fingers to spread the butter after measuring it out.
1. Line the surface of the caramel with the sliced apples. After placing 2 or 3 end slices, lay the rest of the slices around in a circle while overlapping them. (Arranging the slices nicely will give the cake a pretty finish, but for those who don&#39;t mind, just lay the pieces flat.)
1. Put the pot in the oven preheated to 250°C and bake for 12 minutes. If you have space on top of the oven (outside the oven), put the butter for the batter in a heat-resistant dish and simply let the butter melt in residual heat from the oven.
1. While baking the apples, let&#39;s make the batter! Put the almond powder, sugar, and egg white in a bowl, thoroughly mix together with a rubber spatula, then add the egg  yolk, apricot jam, and lemon juice, then thoroughly mix to incorporate air.
1. The apples should be done. Remove the pot from the oven, gently tip the pot, then pour out the juice from the baked apples into a separate dish to adjust the water content. Keep the leftover juices as it&#39;ll be used later.
1. After adjusting the water content, re-position the apple slices in the pot. If there are any gaps or if the apples are not lying flat, use a spoon to  press flat.
1. Set the oven to 200°C. For the batter, sprinkle the butter into the batter from Step 6, mix until smooth, then pour in the leftover apple juices and stir.
1. Combine the cake flour and baking powder and sift into the bowl, then, with a rubber spatula, fold in with cutting motions without kneading. Thoroughly mix until the batter becomes shiny. (With the rubber spatula, repeatedly trace a &#34;J&#34; on the bottom of the pan while turning the bowl towards you.)
1. Pour the batter into the pot, then level it out. Bake for 8 minutes in an oven preheated to 200°C, reset oven to 180°C, then bake for 12 minutes, then reset oven to 170°C and bake for 3 more minutes.
1. It should look like this fresh from the oven. Pierce it with a skewer, and if it comes out clean, it&#39;s finished! Place a sheet of aluminum foil over the pot, and let&#39;s wait for the cake to cool. (If overbaked, the cake will be crumbly and dry).
1. When the cake cools, with the aluminum foil in place, firmly hold the pot, and lightly agitate (give it a good, hard shake to dislodge the contents.) The caramelized apples should separate from the pot, and the cake should come out easily.
1. If the cake doesn&#39;t want to come out, or if the caramel has hardened and the cake won&#39;t budge, heat the pot over the stove and it should come right out. If you force it, the apples will end up a tragic mess, so be careful when removing the cake!
1. Remove the aluminum foil, hold the pot over a dish one size larger than the pot, then carefully flip the pot over.
1. It should look like this.
1. Slice into desired size pieces and serve.
