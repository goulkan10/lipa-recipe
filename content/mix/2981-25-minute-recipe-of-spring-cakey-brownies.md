<i>Before you jump to Cakey brownies recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about {<strong>Easy Ways to Get Healthy</strong>.</i>
Getting A Healthy Eater

    
Camp cooking can be as complicated or simple as you would like it to be. If you would like to prepare fast and easy but nutritious meals as you're camping, camp cooking does not even need to require a flame. However, if you are interested in fueling your camping trip having a feast, then camp cooking can make it possible for you to make hot, healthy foods that are as great as you can create them at home in your own kitchen.

Camp cooking doesn't have to be limited to sandwiches and baked potatoes wrapped in aluminum foil.  Almost any cooking process you are using from the kitchen can be duplicated around the campfire. For example, use a dutch oven or pit cooking to bake your meals. You may also easily fry foods in a bowl over a grill, or boil, braise and beverage. Which sort of camping cookware is ideal for you? Camp cooking and cleanup can be easy or a hassle, but it all starts with great camping equipment.

Some pots/pans come in places that mate together or"nest" for storage and also let you tuck a spoonful of fuel inside them. This really also comes in handy when you're looking to save space whilst camping.

Listed below are some camping things to consider with you if you are thinking about preparing some meals around the campfire. These common kitchen items allow you to duplicate tasty meals when you're out of doors.

• Salt and pepper
• Other your favourite herbs and spices
• Cooking oil
• Pot holder

• Aluminum foil
• Tongs and spatula
• Cutting knives
• Cutting board
• Mixing bowl
• Paper or plastic silverware, plates and cups

When you have just a couple of campers and are looking for some very easy camp cooking, try out the easy and quick technique of tin may cooking. All you will need is a fresh tin can -- a 1 gallon size can works nicely. Your source of heat can be a little campfire, or if wood burning is illegal, a little buddy burner may work well, which can be found at sporting good stores or online. Place your meal from the tin can and just warm the contents of your can over a fire. You will have a hot meal ready in seconds.  This technique works great for soups, beans and tuna fish.

A more time-consuming pub cooking technique which also produces tasty food is pit cooking. Pit cooking is good for items which may be wrapped in aluminum foil to be cooked.  It is also a great camp cooking system if you are using a dutch oven or cast iron cookware. Pit cooking warms your meals by heating stones and coals which are buried in the floor. As the stones cool , their emitted heat cooks the meals. To pit cook, first dig a hole that's roughly three times larger than your cookware. Line the pit with rocks and create a fire in the center. Once the flame has burnt rapidly for about an hour, push the hot coals and stones into the middle. Layer your wrapped food covered skillets on top of the rocks and coals and place more on top. After a number of hours, you'll have some tasty camp food to relish.

Spoiler: Sour cream is the secret icing ingredient! Fudgy brownies have a higher fat-to-flour ratio than cakey ones. A cakey batch has more flour and relies on baking powder for leavening. The amount of sugar and eggs does not change whether you&#39;re. Also place one of the oven racks in the center of the oven.
