I don&#39;t hold this vegetarian pie to be in anyway authentic Indian in its construct (BIG), the filling (VEG loaded!) and the use of puff pastry instead of homemade samosa pastry (handy!). But I do hope those of Indian background can recognise that I&#39;ve stayed respectable of traditional Samosas by using authentic Samosa filling spices. Are these samosas vegetarian or even vegan? These are the best Indian punjabi samosas and they are vegetarian. Infact these samosas are also naturally vegan like a lot of Indian cooking, so if you are looking for vegan festive options, these will please you!
