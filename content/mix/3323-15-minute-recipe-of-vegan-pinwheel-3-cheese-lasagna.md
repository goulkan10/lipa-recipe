Here is the first and maybe the very best reason to use the crock pot in your summer meal planning. You should also look at that by not heating the home by employing your stove or oven you are also preventing your air conditioning (or other cooling methods) from working overtime in order to compensate for the additional heat which other cooking systems introduce.
