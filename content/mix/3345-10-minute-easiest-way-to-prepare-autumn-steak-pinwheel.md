Camp cooking can be as complicated or simple as you want it to be. If you want to prepare quick and simple but healthy meals while you're camping, camp cooking does not even need to require a flame. But if you are interested in ridding your camping trip having a feast, then camp cooking can allow you to earn warm, healthy foods that are as great as you can make them at home in your kitchen.

Camp cooking doesn't need to be limited to sandwiches and baked potatoes wrapped in aluminum foil.  Almost any cooking system you use in the kitchen can be replicated around the campfire. For example, use a dutch oven or pit cooking to bake your meals. You might also easily bake foods at a pan over a grill, or boil, braise and roast. What sort of camping cookware is ideal for you? Camp cooking and cleanup may be easy or a hassle, but it all starts with great camping gear.

Some pots/pans arrive in places that partner together or"nest" for storage and also let you tuck a canister of fuel inside them. This really comes in handy when you're trying to save space while camping.

Following are some camping items to consider with you if you're considering preparing some meals around the home. These common kitchen items allow you to duplicate tasty meals while you're out of doors.

• Salt and pepper
• Other of your favorite herbs and spices
• Cooking oil
• Pot holder

• Aluminum foil
• Tongs and spatula
• Cutting knives
• Cutting board
• Mixing bowl


When you have only a couple of campers and are searching for some very easy camp cooking, try the simple and speedy technique of tin could cooking. All you will need is a clean tin can -- a one gallon size may works well. Your source of heat can be a little campfire, or when wood burning is illegal, a small buddy burner will work nicely, which can be seen at sporting good stores or online. Put your meal from the tin could and easily warm the contents of your own can over a fire. You'll have a hot meal ready in seconds.  This technique works great for sauces, beans and poultry.

A more time-consuming camp cooking technique which also produces yummy food is pit cooking. Pit cooking is good for items that can be wrapped in aluminum foil to be cooked.  It's also a great camp cooking system if you're using a dutch oven or cast iron cookware. Pit cooking calms your food by heating stones and coals which are buried in the ground. As the stones cool away, their emitted heat cooks the meals. To pit cook, first dig a hole that's roughly three times bigger than your cookware. Line the pit with stones and create a fire in the center. Once the flame has burned rapidly for approximately an hour, push the hot coals and rocks into the center. Twist your wrapped food covered skillets on top of the stones and coals and put more on top. After a couple of hours, you'll have some delicious camp food to relish.
