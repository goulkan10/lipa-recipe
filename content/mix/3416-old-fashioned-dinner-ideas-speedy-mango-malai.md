<i>Before you jump to Mango malai recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about {<strong>The Basics of Being Healthy</strong>.</i>
Becoming A Healthy Eater


After the weather outside warms up, the kitchen may be a horrible place to be. There are a lot of things you can do yet, when it comes to cooking a great home made meal which does not require conventional stove top or oven cooking. Learn how to use some of the lesser heat generating equipment in your own kitchen, such as the crock pot, in order to truly conquer the summer heat and keep your cool when preparing a nice warm meal for friends and loved ones.

So, how can crock pot cooking actually help overcome the heat? Simply put, that the crock pot in and of itself puts off far less heat compared to cooking than the oven or stove top. This is the first and possibly the best reason to use the crock pot in summer time meal preparation. You should also look at the fact that by not heating your home by utilizing your stove or oven you're also preventing your air conditioning (or alternative cooling systems ) from working overtime in order to compensate for the additional heat that other cooking methods introduce.

This leaves crock pot cooking a win-win scenario since the expenses involved in operating a crock pot are far less compared to the costs involved in operating a stove or oven generally. Whether gas or electric, your cooker and oven tend to be significant energy hogs. Add to this the fact that you're not increasing the warmth in your house by conventional way of cooking and you're using less electricity.

Unfortunately for many, the general consensus was the crock pots were meant for comfort foods and hearty winter meals.  The truth is that the crock pot should be one of the most loved and most frequently utilized cooking methods in case it's possible to handle it. In regards to cooking with a crock pot, the options are nearly limitless.  Virtually anything that can be baked can be made in the crock pot and many, many more wonderful and enticing foods and snacks too.



Besides the cost benefits mentioned above as it pertains to crock pot cooking there are quite a few other advantages which are well worth mentioning. First of all, the majority of the work entailed with crock pot cooking takes place early in the afternoon when you're refreshed instead of at the end of a hectic work or play day. This means that you are not as likely to forget a component or make other mistakes that frequently happen as we prepare a dinner when we are exhausted in the activities of our day.

Second, many good crock pot recipes include the vegetables that guarantee we are getting the nutrients we need. So often, when preparing a meal at the last minute, vegetables and other side dishes are left out in favour of expedience. Crock pot cooking many cases is really a meal in 1 dish.

Another terrific reason to use a crock pot for your summertime cooking is the ease of clean up.  Unlike vegetables and pans, many crock pot meals are created in 1 dish. This means that there will not be mountains of meals to be either hand washed or packed to the dishwasher (or in case you're like me-both) afterwards. It is possible to spend less time cleaning as you spent less time slaving over a hot cooker. Oh wait! Make that no time slaving over a hot stove. Once clean up is complete you can get back to enjoying the sun set, pursuing the lightening bugs with your little ones, or even waiting for the first superstar.

While there'll never be a one size fits all best cooking method, crock pot cooking comes very near. When you have a crock pot collecting dust somewhere in the back of your pantry it is time to get out it, dust offand dig some wonderful summer crock pot cooking recipes.
