ratingvalue: 3.5
reviewcount: 5
recipeingredient:
- "1 23 lb beef rump roast"
- "3 tbs cooking oil suitable for high heat I use light olive oil"
- "1 medium yellow onion  peeled and diced to 14 pieces"
- "4 cloves garlic  crushed"
- "3 tbsp allpurpose flour"
- "3 cups low sodium beef broth"
- "1/2 cup marsala wine optional"
- "4 medium potatoes  peeled cut in thirds across"
- "3-4 medium carrots  peeled cut in thirds across"
- "3 medium turnips  quartered"
- "2 large parsnips  peeled cut in half across fat ends quartered"
- "To taste salt and pepper"
recipeinstructions:
- "Let roast sit out at room temp while you prep all your veggies. Set veggies aside, but do not mix. Place only the potatoes in a bowl of cold water to prevent discoloration."
- "Generously sprinkle roast with salt and pepper on all sides (this is a large piece of meat, more flavor/seasoning on the outside=better flavor inside)."
- "Heat a large dutch oven (or other heavy bottomed, oven safe pot) over medium high heat - you seriously want this thing scorching for the best sear. Add oil. As soon as it shimmers use good tongs to place roast in pot, fat side down."
- "Sear roast on all sides, do not turn to new side until currently cooking side easily releases from the pot (you&#39;ll see what I mean). When roast is nicely browned on all sides pull out of pot and place on a plate off to the side. Preheat oven to 450°F at this time."
- "Reduce stove top heat to medium. Add onion and crushed garlic to the pot. Sautée 2 minutes, stirring constantly. Add flour and cook 2 minutes more, wisking constantly."
- "Wisk in broth and marsala. Bring to a simmer wisking frequently, until sauce just begins to thicken. Do not season at this time. Return roast to pot. Turn to coat in sauce, finishing fat side up."
- "Arrange veggies around roast layered: turnips first, then parsnips, carrots, and potatoes last. The potatoes do not need to be fully submerged, and your roast will not be fully submerged. This is what you want. Place lid on pot. Place pot in oven. Reduce oven heat to 250°F immediately. Cook roast covered 2.5 - 3 hrs."
- "Remove from oven. Using tongs, transfer roast to a cutting board. Tent with foil to rest at least 10 minutes, DO NOT cut immediately. Use a slotted spoon to remove veggies from pot to a platter, tent with foil to keep warm."
- "Place pot over medium high heat on stove top. Bring sauce to a rapid boil. Boil until reduced by half, stirring often. Taste (careul it&#39;s hot lol) and add salt and pepper as desired. Turn off heat."
- "To serve, thinly slice roast against the grain. Plate with veggies and drizzle with sauce. Enjoy!"
- "See notes below ⤵"
- "Note 1: If you do not want to use marsala add an additional 1/2 cup of beef broth to substitute."
- "Note 2: For a smooth sauce pour through a fine mesh strainer to remove the broken down bits of onion and garlic. We personally like the extra pieces in ours."

<i>Before you jump to Perfect Pot Roast &amp; Vegetables recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about {<strong>The Basics of Being Healthy</strong>.</i>
Getting A Healthy Eater

It's possible for people to make healthy food choices even if they just have a short period in which to prepare their meals. The first point to see is that it's often that healthy choices do not always signify a need for two-hour meals. A person could select healthy foods that are quick and simple to prepare at home or to pick out of a takeout place. Cities frequently offer restaurant guides in their telephone books that show full-page menus indicating what a particular restaurant or drive-thru offers. Many of these food vendors now include healthy alternatives to their usual fast-food choice.

 This has motivated the restaurants to offer other options in their hamburger choices. Hamburgers may be ordered with no bun, for example, and fruit and yogurt are contained on the menu along with fresh cakes. Many restaurants provide salad options either as side orders or as whole meals. Many times, a salad of fresh vegetables with chopped ham, roast beef or chicken is much more appealing than normal menu items.  Salads are particularly attractive in the summer months since they are milder on the digestive system.

Restaurants that feature foods in year cultivated by local farmers offer very healthy and affordable options. Some of these kinds of restaurants will produce their own recipes for healthy food options.  This provides the user with a totally fresh selection and encourages them to visit the restaurant .

If home preparation of food is favored, the alternatives for healthy choices increase. Visiting a neighborhood grocery store or grocery store emphasizes the number of healthy choices that are readily available. Fresh fruits and vegetables are more varied than ever before due to developments in transport and preservation procedures.  All sorts of cuisine can be prepared quickly because of the choices of fresh goods rather than frozen foods. There are many choices among frozen foods too. The demand for healthy frozen dinners and other foods has increased alongside demands for greater variety in frozen food offerings. Any frozen food aisle at almost any supermarket will reveal as several healthy food options and poor choices. The choice is left up to the person.

People may either decide to consume a healthy diet program or an unhealthy one. Time and access to healthy options are no longer problems for someone who is trying to eat better and healthier foods.

##### Instructions to make Perfect Pot Roast &amp; Vegetables:

1. Let roast sit out at room temp while you prep all your veggies. Set veggies aside, but do not mix. Place only the potatoes in a bowl of cold water to prevent discoloration.
1. Generously sprinkle roast with salt and pepper on all sides (this is a large piece of meat, more flavor/seasoning on the outside=better flavor inside).
1. Heat a large dutch oven (or other heavy bottomed, oven safe pot) over medium high heat - you seriously want this thing scorching for the best sear. Add oil. As soon as it shimmers use good tongs to place roast in pot, fat side down.
1. Sear roast on all sides, do not turn to new side until currently cooking side easily releases from the pot (you&#39;ll see what I mean). When roast is nicely browned on all sides pull out of pot and place on a plate off to the side. Preheat oven to 450°F at this time.
1. Reduce stove top heat to medium. Add onion and crushed garlic to the pot. Sautée 2 minutes, stirring constantly. Add flour and cook 2 minutes more, wisking constantly.
1. Wisk in broth and marsala. Bring to a simmer wisking frequently, until sauce just begins to thicken. Do not season at this time. Return roast to pot. Turn to coat in sauce, finishing fat side up.
1. Arrange veggies around roast layered: turnips first, then parsnips, carrots, and potatoes last. The potatoes do not need to be fully submerged, and your roast will not be fully submerged. This is what you want. Place lid on pot. Place pot in oven. Reduce oven heat to 250°F immediately. Cook roast covered 2.5 - 3 hrs.
1. Remove from oven. Using tongs, transfer roast to a cutting board. Tent with foil to rest at least 10 minutes, DO NOT cut immediately. Use a slotted spoon to remove veggies from pot to a platter, tent with foil to keep warm.
1. Place pot over medium high heat on stove top. Bring sauce to a rapid boil. Boil until reduced by half, stirring often. Taste (careul it&#39;s hot lol) and add salt and pepper as desired. Turn off heat.
1. To serve, thinly slice roast against the grain. Plate with veggies and drizzle with sauce. Enjoy!
1. See notes below ⤵
1. Note 1: If you do not want to use marsala add an additional 1/2 cup of beef broth to substitute.
1. Note 2: For a smooth sauce pour through a fine mesh strainer to remove the broken down bits of onion and garlic. We personally like the extra pieces in ours.


Sprinkle with salt and pepper and cover with the lid. Bring the liquid to a boil, then reduce heat to a simmer. Cover the pot, place it in. In large, heavy skillet, melt butter and heat on medium high until foamy. Add roast to pan and brown on all sides.
