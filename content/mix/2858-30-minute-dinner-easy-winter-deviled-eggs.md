Becoming A Healthy Eater

    
Camp cooking can be as complicated or simple as you would like it to be. If you want to prepare fast and simple but nutritious meals when you are swimming, camp cooking doesn't even have to need a flame. However, if you're considering fueling your camping excursion having a feast, camp cooking can allow you to earn hot, healthy foods that are as good as you can create them at home in your own kitchen.

Camp cooking doesn't have to be limited to sandwiches and baked potatoes wrapped in aluminum foil.  Almost any cooking method you are using from the kitchen could be replicated around the home. For example, use a dutch oven or pit cooking to bake your food. You could also easily fry foods at a bowl over a grill, or boil, braise and roast. What kind of camping cookware is best for you? Camp cooking and cleanup can be easy or a hassle, it all starts with great camping equipment.

Some pots/pans come in sets that mate jointly or"nest" for storage and even let you tuck a spoonful of gas within them. This really also comes in handy when you're searching to save space whilst camping.

Listed below are some camping items to take with you if you are thinking about preparing some meals around the home. These frequent kitchen items allow you to replicate yummy meals as you're out of doors.

• Salt and pepper
• Other your favorite herbs and spices
• Cooking oil
• Pot holder
• Hand-held can opener
• Aluminum foil

• Cutting knives
• Cutting board
• Mixing bowl
• Paper or plastic silverware, plates and cups

When you have only a couple campers and are looking for some very easy camp cooking, try out the simple and fast technique of tin can cooking. All you'll need is a clean tin can -- a one gallon size may works nicely. Your source of heat can be a little campfire, or when wood burning is illegal, a small buddy burner may work nicely, which may be found at sporting good stores or online. Put your meal in the tin can and just warm the contents of your can over a flame. You will have a hot meal ready in minutes.  This technique works great for soups, beans and tuna fish.

A more time-consuming camp cooking technique which also produces tasty food is pit cooking. Pit cooking is terrific for items which could be wrapped in aluminum foil to be cooked.  It's also a great camp cooking method if you're using a dutch oven or cast iron cookware. Pit cooking calms your meals by heating rocks and coals that are buried in the ground. As the rocks cool , their emitted heat cooks the meals. To pit cook, first dig a hole that's about three times larger than your cookware. Line the pit with rocks and construct a fire in the middle. When the fire has burned rapidly for about one hourpush the hot coals and rocks into the center. Layer your wrapped meals covered skillets in addition to the stones and coals and place more on top. Following a number of hours, you will have some delicious camp food to relish.
