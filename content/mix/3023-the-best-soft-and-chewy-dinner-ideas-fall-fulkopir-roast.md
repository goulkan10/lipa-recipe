This means that there is not going to be mountains of dishes to be either hand cleaned or loaded to the dishwasher (or if you are like me-both) later. You can spend less time cleaning only as you spent less time slaving over a hot stove. Oh wait! Make that no time slaving over a hot stove. After clean up is complete you can contact enjoying the sun set, chasing the lightening bugs along with your small ones, or even waiting for the very first superstar.
