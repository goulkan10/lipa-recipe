Learn how to use some of these heat producing equipment in your own kitchen, like the crock pot, to be able to genuinely beat the summer heat and maintain your cool when preparing a wonderful hot meal for friends and loved ones.

So, how can crock pot cooking actually help overcome the heat? Simply put, that the crock pot in and of itself puts off a lot less heat when cooking compared to the oven or stove top.

 Unlike vegetables and pans, many crock pot foods are created in one dish. This means that there won't be mountains of meals to be either hand cleaned or packed to the dishwasher (or in case you're like me-both) later. You can spend less time cleaning as you spent less time slaving over a hot cooker. Oh wait! Make that no time slaving over a hot stove. Once tidy is complete you can get back to enjoying the sunshine set, pursuing the lightening bugs along with your little ones, or even waiting for the first star.

While there'll be no 1 size fits all best cooking procedure, crock pot cooking comes really near. When you have a crock pot collecting dust somewhere in the back of your pantry it's the right time to get out it, dust in the off, and dig up some fantastic summer crock pot cooking recipes.
