You should also think about that by not heating the home by employing your stove or oven you're also avoiding your air conditioning (or additional heating methods) from working overtime in order to compensate for the extra heat which other cooking systems pose.

This leaves crock pot cooking a win-win scenario as the costs involved in operating a crock pot are much less than the costs involved in operating a cooker or stove generally. Whether electric or gas, your cooker and oven tend to be serious energy hogs. Add to this the fact that you're not raising the warmth in your home by traditional means of cooking and you are using even less power.

Unfortunately for many, the general consensus has been that crock pots were intended for comfort foods and hearty winter meals.

This usually means that you are less inclined to forget an ingredient or make different mistakes that frequently occur as we hurriedly prepare a dinner when we are tired in the actions of our day.

Second, many good crock pot recipes include the vegetables that guarantee we are getting the nutrients that we need. So frequently, when planning a meal in the last moment, vegetables and other side dishes have been made in favour of expedience. Crock pot cooking in many instances is a meal in 1 dish.

One other great reason to use a crock pot for your summer cooking is the ease of clean up.  Unlike pots and pans, most crock pot dishes are made in 1 dish. This means that there won't be mountains of dishes to be hand washed or loaded into the dishwasher (or in case you are like me-both) later. It is possible to spend less time cleaning only as you spent time slaving over a hot stove. Oh wait! Ensure time slaving over a hot stove. After clean up is complete you can contact enjoying the sunshine set, pursuing the lightening bugs along with your little ones, or waiting for the first star.

While there will never be a one size fits all best cooking method, crock pot cooking comes really near. If you've got a crock pot gathering dust somewhere in the back of your pantry it is the right time to get out it, dust if offand dig some great summertime crock pot cooking recipes.
