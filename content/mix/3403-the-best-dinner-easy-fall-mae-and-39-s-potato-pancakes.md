Getting A Healthy Eater

    
Camp cooking can be as complicated or simple as you would like it to be. If you would like to prepare fast and simple but nutritious meals while you are camping, camp cooking does not even need to need a flame. But if you are considering fueling your camping excursion with a feast, camp cooking can enable you to make warm, healthy foods which are as good as you can make them at home in your kitchen.

Camp cooking doesn't need to be limited to sandwiches and baked potatoes wrapped in aluminum foil.  Just about any cooking system you are using in the kitchen can be replicated around the campfire. For instance, use a dutch oven or pit cooking to bake your meals. You may also easily bake foods at a bowl over a grill, or boil, braise and beverage. What kind of camping cookware is ideal for you? Camp cooking and clean-up may be easy or a hassle, but it all starts with great camping equipment.

Some pots/pans arrive in sets that mate together or"nest" for storage and even let you tuck a spoonful of gas within them. This really comes in handy once you're looking to save room whilst camping.

Following are some camping items to carry with you if you're thinking about preparing some meals around the campfire. These frequent kitchen items will allow you to duplicate tasty meals as you are out of doors.


• Other your favourite herbs and spices
• Cooking oil
• Pot holder

• Aluminum foil

• Cutting knives
• Cutting board
• Mixing bowl
• Paper or plastic silverware, plates and cups

When you have only a few campers and are searching for some easy camp cooking, try the simple and quick technique of tin could cooking. All you'll need is a clean tin can -- a 1 gallon size can works nicely. Your source of heat may be small campfire, or if wood burning is prohibited, a little buddy burner may work nicely, which can be seen at sporting good stores or online. Put your meal from the tin could and just warm the contents of your can over a fire. You will have a hot meal ready in minutes.  This technique works great for sauces, beans and poultry.

A more time-consuming camp cooking technique that also produces delectable food is pit cooking.  It is also a great camp cooking system if you're using a dutch oven or cast iron cookware. Pit cooking calms your meals by heating stones and coals which are buried in the floor. As the rocks cool away, their emitted heat cooks the food. To pit cook, first dig a hole that is roughly three times bigger than your cookware. Line the pit with stones and create a fire in the center. When the flame has burned rapidly for approximately an hour, push the warm coals and rocks into the middle. Twist your wrapped meals or covered skillets in addition to the stones and coals and place more on top. After a couple of hours, you'll have some tasty camp food to relish.
