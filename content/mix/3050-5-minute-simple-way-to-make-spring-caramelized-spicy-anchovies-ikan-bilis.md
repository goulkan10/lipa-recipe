This means that there won't be mountains of meals to be either hand cleaned or loaded into the dishwasher (or in case you're like me-both) later. It is possible to spend less time cleaning as you spent less time slaving over a hot stove. Oh wait! Ensure time slaving over a hot stove. Once tidy is complete you can get back to enjoying the sunshine set, pursuing the lightening bugs with your small ones, or waiting for the first star.
