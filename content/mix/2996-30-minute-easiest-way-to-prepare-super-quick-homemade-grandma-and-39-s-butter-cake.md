Becoming A Healthy Eater

    
Camp cooking can be as complicated or simple as you want it to be. If you would like to prepare quick and simple but healthy meals while you're camping, camp cooking doesn't even need to require a flame. But if you're considering fueling your camping trip with a feast, camp cooking can make it possible for you to make hot, healthy foods which are as good as you can make them at home in your own kitchen.

 Just about any cooking process you are using in the kitchen can be duplicated around the campfire. For example, use a dutch oven or pit cooking to bake your food. You could also easily bake foods in a bowl over a grill, or boil, braise and roast. What type of camping cookware is best for you? Camp cooking and clean-up can be easy or a hassle, and it all starts with great camping gear.

Some pots/pans arrive in sets that mate together or"nest" for storage and also let you tuck a canister of fuel inside them. This really comes in handy once you're trying to save space while camping.

Listed below are some camping items to carry with you if you are planning on preparing some meals around the campfire. These common kitchen items allow you to replicate yummy meals as you are out of doors.


• Other of your favorite herbs and spices
• Cooking oil
• Pot holder
• Hand-held can opener
• Aluminum foil

• Cutting knives
• Cutting board
• Mixing bowl


In case you have just a few campers and are searching for some simple camp cooking, try the simple and quick technique of tin may cooking. All you will need is a clean tin can -- a 1 gallon size can works nicely. Your source of heat may be little campfire, or if wood burning is illegal, a small buddy burner may work well, which can be seen at sporting good stores or online. Put your meal from the tin could and easily warm the contents of your can over a fire.  This technique works great for soups, beans and poultry.

A more time-consuming pub cooking technique that also produces delectable food is pit cooking.  It's also a great camp cooking method if you are using a dutch oven or cast iron cookware. Pit cooking calms your meals by heating stones and coals that are concealed in the floor. As the rocks cool off, their emitted heat cooks the meals. To pit cook, first dig a hole that is approximately three times larger than your own cookware. Line the pit with stones and construct a fire in the middle. When the flame has burned rapidly for about an hour, push the warm coals and stones into the center. Layer your wrapped food covered skillets on top of the rocks and coals and place more on top. Following a few hours, you will have some tasty camp food to enjoy.
