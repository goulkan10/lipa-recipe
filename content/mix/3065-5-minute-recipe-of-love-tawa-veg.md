 Unlike pans and pans, most crock pot foods are created in one dish. This means that there will not be mountains of meals to be either hand cleaned or packed to the dishwasher (or if you are like me-both) afterwards. You're able to spend less time cleaning only as you spent time slaving over a hot stove. Oh wait! Ensure time slaving over a hot cooker. Once clean up is complete you can get back to enjoying the sunshine set, pursuing the lightening bugs with your small ones, or even waiting for the very first superstar.
