Getting A Healthy Eater

    
Camp cooking can be as elaborate or simple as you want it to be. If you would like to prepare quick and simple but healthy meals when you are swimming, camp cooking does not even have to require a fire. But if you're considering fueling your camping excursion having a feast, then camp cooking can make it possible for you to make warm, healthy foods that are as great as you can create them at home in your own kitchen.

 Almost any cooking system you are using from the kitchen can be duplicated around the campfire. For instance, use a toaster or pit cooking to consume your meals. You can also easily bake foods in a bowl over a grill, or boil, braise and beverage. Which sort of camping cookware is ideal for you? Camp cooking and cleanup may be easy or a hassle, and it all starts with great camping gear.

Some pots/pans come in sets that mate together or"nest" for storage and also allow you to tuck a spoonful of gas within them. This really comes in handy when you're trying to save space whilst camping.

Listed below are some camping items to carry with you if you are thinking about preparing some meals around the home. These common kitchen items allow you to replicate yummy meals when you're out of doorways.


• Other of your favorite herbs and spices
• Cooking oil
• Pot holder
• Hand-held can opener
• Aluminum foil

• Cutting knives
• Cutting board
• Mixing bowl
• Paper or plastic silverware, plates and cups

If you have just a few campers and are searching for some simple camp cooking, try the easy and quick technique of tin could cooking. All you will need is a clean tin can -- a 1 gallon size can works nicely. Your source of heat can be a little campfire, or when wood burning is illegal, a little buddy burner will work well, which may be seen at sporting good stores or online. Put your meal in the tin could and simply heat the contents of your can over a fire.  This technique works great for soups, beans and poultry.

A more time-consuming camp cooking technique that also produces yummy food is pit cooking.  It's also a great camp cooking system if you're using a dutch oven or cast iron cookware. Pit cooking warms your meals by heating stones and coals that are concealed in the ground. As the stones cool away, their emitted heat cooks the meals. To pit cookfirst dig a hole that's approximately three times bigger than your cookware. Line the pit with stones and build a fire in the center. Once the fire has burned rapidly for about one hourpush the hot coals and stones into the middle. Layer your wrapped meals covered skillets in addition to the stones and coals and place on top. After a number of hours, you'll have some tasty camp food to relish.

My lighter versions swaps the rice for cauliflower rice and rather than frying, I made them in my air fryer or oven!

Jollof rice is a very common dish prepared in many African countries and each recipe differs depending on the nation.
