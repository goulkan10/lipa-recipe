You should also consider the fact that by not heating your house by using your stove top or oven you are also preventing your air conditioning (or other heating methods) from working overtime so as to compensate for the extra heat which other cooking methods pose.

This leaves crock pot cooking a win-win situation as the expenses involved in operating a crock pot are far less than the costs involved in managing a cooker or stove generally. Whether gas or electric, your cooker and oven tend to be serious energy hogs.

This usually means that you're not as likely to forget an ingredient or make other errors that frequently occur as we hurriedly prepare a dinner when we are tired from the actions of our day.

Secondly, many great crock pot recipes include the vegetables that insure we're getting the nutrients we need. So often, when preparing a meal at the last moment, vegetables and other side dishes have been left out in favour of expedience. Crock pot cooking in many instances is really a meal in one dish.

 Unlike pans and pans, many crock pot foods are made in one dish. This means that there won't be mountains of meals to be hand cleaned or packed into the dishwasher (or if you are like me-both) later. You can spend less time cleaning as you spent time slaving over a hot cooker. Oh wait! Make that time slaving over a hot stove. Once clean up is complete you can contact enjoying the sunshine set, pursuing the lightening bugs with your little ones, or even waiting for the first celebrity.

While there'll be no 1 size fits all ideal cooking process, crock pot cooking comes very near. In case you've got a crock pot collecting dust somewhere in the rear of your pantry it's time to get out it, dust offand dig up some excellent summer crock pot cooking recipes.
