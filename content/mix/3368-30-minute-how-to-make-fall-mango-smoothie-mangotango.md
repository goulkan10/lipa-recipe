This is the first and maybe the best reason to use the crock pot on your summer meal preparation. You should also consider that by not heating your house by utilizing your stove top or oven you are also avoiding your air conditioning (or other heating methods) from working overtime to be able to compensate for the additional heat that other cooking systems pose.

This makes crock pot cooking a win-win situation as the expenses involved in operating a crock pot are far less compared to the expenses related to managing a cooker or stove generally. Whether electric or gas, your stove and oven tend to be significant energy hogs. Add to that the fact that you are not raising the temperature in your house by traditional way of cooking and you are using even less power.

Second, many good crock pot recipes include the vegetables that insure we are getting the nutrients we need. So often, when preparing a meal at the last moment, vegetables and other side dishes have been left out in favour of expedience. Crock pot cooking many instances is really a meal in 1 dish.

Another excellent reason to use a crock pot for the summer cooking is that the ease of clean up.  Unlike pots and pans, many crock pot foods are created in one dish. This usually means that there won't be mountains of meals to be either hand washed or loaded to the dishwasher (or in case you are like me-both) afterwards. It's possible to spend less time cleaning just as you spent less time slaving over a hot cooker. Oh wait! Make that no time slaving over a hot cooker. After clean up is complete you can get back to enjoying the sun set, chasing the lightening bugs along with your little ones, or even waiting for the first celebrity.

While there'll be no one size fits all best cooking method, crock pot cooking comes very close. When you've got a crock pot gathering dust somewhere in the rear of your pantry it is the right time to get out it, dust in the offand dig up some amazing summer crock pot cooking recipes.
