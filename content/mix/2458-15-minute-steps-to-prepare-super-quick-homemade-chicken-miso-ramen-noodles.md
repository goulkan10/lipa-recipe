Make the ramen miso base, cook the chicken, cook the egg and then cook the noodles. There isn&#39;t too much chopping work either - mainly just the spring onion and slicing the stalks from the pak choy. Stir in your garlic, ginger, chili paste, miso paste, and mirin, and Â¼ cup of the chicken stock. Cook for a few minutes until all the ingredients create a thick sauce. Now slowly pour in the rest of the chicken stock, cover with a lid, and bring to a boil.
