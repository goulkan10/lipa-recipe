You might also easily bake foods at a bowl over a grill, or boil, braise and roast. Which type of camping cookware is best for you?

Once the fire has burned rapidly for about an hourpush the warm coals and rocks into the middle. Twist your wrapped food covered skillets on top of the stones and coals and place on top.
