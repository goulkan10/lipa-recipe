Second, many good crock pot recipes include the vegetables that insure we are getting the nutrients that we need. So often, when planning a meal at the last minute, vegetables and other side dishes have been left out in favor of expedience. Crock pot cooking in many cases is a meal in one dish.

Another great reason to use a crock pot for the summer cooking is that the ease of clean up.  Unlike pans and pans, many crock pot dishes are made in 1 dish. This usually means that there is not going to be mountains of dishes to be hand cleaned or packed to the dishwasher (or in case you're like me-both) afterwards. You're able to spend less time cleaning only as you spent less time slaving over a hot stove. Oh wait! Make that time slaving over a hot stove. After tidy is complete you can get back to enjoying the sun set, chasing the lightening bugs along with your little ones, or waiting for your very first star.

While there will be no one size fits all very ideal cooking procedure, crock pot cooking comes really close. When you have a crock pot gathering dust somewhere in the back of your pantry it's the right time to get it out, dust offand dig some wonderful summertime crock pot cooking recipes.
