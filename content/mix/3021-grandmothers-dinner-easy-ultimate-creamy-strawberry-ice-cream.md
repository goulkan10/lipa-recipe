Getting A Healthy Eater

    
Camp cooking can be as elaborate or simple as you would like it to be. If you want to prepare fast and easy but healthy meals when you are swimming, camp cooking does not even need to need a fire. But if you are thinking about fueling your camping trip with a feast, camp cooking can allow you to make hot, healthy foods that are as great as you can create them at home in your kitchen.

 Just about any cooking procedure you are using in the kitchen could be duplicated around the home. For example, use a dutch oven or pit cooking to bake your food. You could also easily bake foods in a pan over a grill, or boil, braise and beverage. What sort of camping cookware is best for you? Camp cooking and cleanup may be easy or a hassle, but it all starts with great camping equipment.

Some pots/pans come in places that mate together or"nest" for storage and also let you tuck a canister of fuel inside them. This really comes in handy when you're trying to save space whilst camping.

Following are some camping items to carry with you if you're considering preparing some meals around the home. These common kitchen items allow you to replicate yummy meals as you are out of doors.


• Other of your favourite herbs and spices
• Cooking oil
• Pot holder

• Aluminum foil
• Tongs and spatula
• Cutting knives
• Cutting board
• Mixing bowl
• Paper or plastic silverware, plates and cups

In case you have only a couple campers and are looking for some very simple camp cooking, try out the easy and fast technique of tin can cooking. All you will need is a fresh tin can -- a 1 gallon size can works nicely. Your source of heat may be little campfire, or when wood burning is prohibited, a little buddy burner may work nicely, which can be found at sporting good stores or online. Put your meal in the tin could and just heat the contents of your can over a fire.  This technique works great for soups, beans and tuna fish.

A more time-consuming pub cooking technique which also produces yummy meals is pit cooking. Pit cooking is fantastic for items that may be wrapped in aluminum foil to be cooked.  It is also a great camp cooking method if you are using a dutch oven or cast iron cookware. Pit cooking calms your food by heating rocks and coals that are buried in the floor. As the rocks cool , their emitted heat cooks the food. To pit cookfirst dig a hole that is roughly three times bigger than your cookware. Line the pit with rocks and build a fire in the center. Once the flame has burned rapidly for approximately an hour, push the hot coals and rocks into the middle. Layer your wrapped meals or covered skillets in addition to the rocks and coals and place on top. Following a number of hours, you'll have some delicious camp food to enjoy.

Strawberry rhubarb crisp, in fact, with fresh strawberry ice cream. I wish I could say that the strawberries came from my garden as well, but the squirrels did those in a few years ago and I haven&#39;t planted new ones. This homemade strawberry ice cream is perfect on its own, in milkshakes or in ice cream sandwiches. This homemade strawberry ice cream recipe makes me think of my Grandpa since it&#39;s his favorite.
