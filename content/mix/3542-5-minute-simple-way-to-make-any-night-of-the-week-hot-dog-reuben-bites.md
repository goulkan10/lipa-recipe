This means that there won't be mountains of meals to be hand washed or loaded to the dishwasher (or if you are like me-both) afterwards. You're able to spend less time cleaning as you spent less time slaving over a hot stove. Oh wait! Ensure time slaving over a hot stove. After clean up is complete you can contact enjoying the sun set, chasing the lightening bugs along with your small ones, or even waiting for the first celebrity.
