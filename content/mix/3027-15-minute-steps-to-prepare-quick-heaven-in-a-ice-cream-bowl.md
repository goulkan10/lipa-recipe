Camp cooking can be as complicated or simple as you would like it to be.

But if you are thinking about fueling your camping trip having a feast, then camp cooking can allow you to make warm, healthy foods which are as great as you can make them at home in your kitchen.

Camp cooking does not have to be limited to sandwiches and baked potatoes wrapped in aluminum foil.  Almost any cooking method you use in the kitchen can be duplicated around the home. For example, use a toaster or pit cooking to consume your meals. You could also easily bake foods in a pan over a grill, or boil, braise and roast. What type of camping cookware is best for you? Camp cooking and cleanup may be easy or a hassle, it all starts with great camping equipment.

Some pots/pans come in sets that mate collectively or"nest" for storage and even allow you to tuck a spoonful of fuel inside them. This really comes in handy when you're trying to save room while camping.

When you have just a couple campers and are looking for some very easy camp cooking, try the simple and speedy technique of tin may cooking. All you will need is a fresh tin can -- a one gallon size can works well. Your source of heat may be small campfire, or when wood burning is illegal, a small buddy burner may work well, which may be found at sporting good stores or online. Put your meal from the tin can and simply heat the contents of your own can over a flame.  This technique works great for soups, beans and poultry.

A more time-consuming pub cooking technique which also produces tasty food is pit cooking. Pit cooking is fantastic for items which may be wrapped in aluminum foil to be cooked.  It's also a great camp cooking system if you are using a dutch oven or cast iron cookware. Pit cooking calms your meals by heating rocks and coals that are buried in the ground. As the rocks cool , their emitted heat cooks the meals. To pit cookfirst dig a hole that's roughly three times larger than your own cookware. Line the pit with rocks and construct a fire in the center. When the flame has burnt rapidly for about an hourpush the warm coals and stone into the center. Layer your wrapped meals or covered skillets on top of the stones and coals and put more on top. After a couple of hours, you'll have some delicious camp food to enjoy.
