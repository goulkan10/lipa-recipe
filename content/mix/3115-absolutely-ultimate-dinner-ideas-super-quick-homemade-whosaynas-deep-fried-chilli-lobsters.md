You can also easily fry foods in a pan over a grill, or boil, braise and roast. Which type of camping cookware is best for you? Camp cooking and clean-up can be easy or a hassle, it all starts with great camping gear.

Once the fire has burnt rapidly for approximately one hourpush the hot coals and stone into the center. Twist your wrapped meals or covered skillets in addition to the rocks and coals and place more on top. Following a number of hours, you will have some delicious camp food to enjoy.
