Becoming A Healthy Eater

    
Camp cooking can be as elaborate or simple as you want it to be. If you wish to prepare fast and simple but healthy meals when you are swimming, camp cooking does not even need to need a flame. But if you're interested in fueling your camping trip with a feast, then camp cooking can allow you to make warm, healthy foods that are as great as you can create them at home in your kitchen.

Camp cooking doesn't need to be limited to sandwiches and baked potatoes wrapped in aluminum foil.  Almost any cooking method you are using from the kitchen could be replicated around the campfire. For example, use a toaster or pit cooking to consume your meals. You can also easily fry foods in a pan over a grill, or boil, braise and beverage. What sort of camping cookware is ideal for you? Camp cooking and cleanup may be easy or a hassle, and it all starts with great camping gear.

Some pots/pans arrive in places that mate together or"nest" for storage and also allow you to tuck a canister of gas within them. This comes in handy once you're wanting to save space while camping.

Following are some camping items to take with you if you're considering preparing some meals around the campfire. These frequent kitchen items allow you to duplicate tasty meals while you're out of doors.


• Other your favourite herbs and spices
• Cooking oil
• Pot holder
• Hand-held can opener
• Aluminum foil

• Cutting knives
• Cutting board
• Mixing bowl


When you have only a few campers and are searching for some simple camp cooking, try the easy and speedy technique of tin can cooking. All you'll need is a clean tin can -- a one gallon size may works nicely. Your source of warmth can be a little campfire, or if wood burning is illegal, a small buddy burner may work well, which can be seen at sporting good stores or online. Place your meal in the tin can and just heat the contents of your can over a fire. You'll have a hot meal ready in seconds.  This technique works great for soups, beans and poultry.

A more time-consuming pub cooking technique that also produces delectable meals is pit cooking. Pit cooking is wonderful for items which can be wrapped in aluminum foil to be cooked.  It's also a excellent camp cooking method if you're using a dutch oven or cast iron cookware. Pit cooking calms your food by heating rocks and coals which are buried in the ground. As the rocks cool away, their emitted heat cooks the food. To pit cookfirst dig a hole that is approximately three times bigger than your own cookware. Line the pit with rocks and create a fire in the center. When the flame has burnt rapidly for about one hour, push the warm coals and rocks into the center. Twist your wrapped food or covered skillets on top of the stones and coals and place more on top. After a number of hours, you will have some tasty camp food to relish.
