Becoming A Healthy Eater

    
Camp cooking can be as elaborate or simple as you want it to be. If you would like to prepare quick and simple but healthy meals as you are swimming, camp cooking does not even have to need a flame. But if you are thinking about fueling your camping trip using a feast, then camp cooking can enable you to make hot, healthy foods that are as great as you can create them at home in your own kitchen.

Camp cooking does not need to be limited to sandwiches and baked potatoes wrapped in aluminum foil.  Just about any cooking method you are using in the kitchen can be duplicated around the home. For example, use a dutch oven or pit cooking to consume your meals. You might also easily bake foods in a bowl over a grill, or boil, braise and roast. What sort of camping cookware is ideal for you? Camp cooking and clean-up may be easy or a hassle, and it all starts with great camping equipment.

Some pots/pans come in places that partner jointly or"nest" for storage and even let you tuck a canister of gas within them. This really also comes in handy when you're wanting to save room whilst camping.

Listed below are some camping things to take with you if you're planning on preparing some meals around the campfire. These frequent kitchen items will allow you to replicate yummy meals when you are out of doors.


• Other of your favorite herbs and spices
• Cooking oil
• Pot holder
• Hand-held can opener
• Aluminum foil
• Tongs and spatula
• Cutting knives
• Cutting board
• Mixing bowl


When you have only a couple campers and are looking for some simple camp cooking, try out the easy and fast technique of tin may cooking. All you will need is a fresh tin can -- a one gallon size may works nicely. Your source of warmth can be a small campfire, or when wood burning is illegal, a little buddy burner may work nicely, which may be seen at sporting good stores or online. Place your meal from the tin can and just heat the contents of your own can over a fire.  This technique works great for soups, beans and tuna fish.

A more time-consuming pub cooking technique that also produces yummy meals is pit cooking.  It is also a great camp cooking method if you're using a dutch oven or cast iron cookware. Pit cooking warms your food by heating rocks and coals that are buried in the floor. As the rocks cool off, their emitted heat cooks the food. To pit cook, first dig a hole that is roughly three times bigger than your own cookware. Line the pit with rocks and build a fire in the middle. Once the flame has burnt rapidly for about an hour, push the warm coals and rocks into the center. Layer your wrapped meals covered skillets in addition to the stones and coals and place on top. Following a number of hours, you will have some delicious camp food to relish.
