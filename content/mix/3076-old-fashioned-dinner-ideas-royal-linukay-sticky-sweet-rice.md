Sticky rice becomes even stickier and slightly translucent when allowed to sit or when cooled and refrigerated. Sticky rice is also used to make scrumptious Thai desserts, such as mango sticky rice. Store sticky rice covered in the refrigerator, but be sure to eat it up within a day or two, as it will harden faster than regular rice. In Thailand, sticky rice is steamed in a basket made from bamboo called a teeneung khao neow (ที่นึ่งข้าวเหนียว). The basket is the shape of a big cone, closed off at one end, and open and wide at the top.
