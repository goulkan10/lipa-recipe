Good by themselves, meatball subs, pasta sauce, etc. very versatile. So glad I found this recipe! Wrap the crackers in a tea towel and smash up until fine, breaking up any big bits with your hands, then tip into a large bowl. Pick and finely chop the rosemary, then add to the bowl with the mustard, minced meat and oregano. Crack the egg into the bowl, then add a good pinch of sea salt and black pepper.
