<i>Before you jump to Microwave Nutella Mug Cake recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about {<strong>The Basics of Being Healthy</strong>.</i>
Getting A Healthy Eater


After the weather warms up, the kitchen may be a horrible place to be. There are several things you can do however, when it comes to cooking a wonderful homemade meal that does not require conventional stove top or oven cooking. Learn to utilize some of the lesser heat producing equipment in your own kitchen, such as the crock pot, in order to truly conquer the summertime and maintain your cool when preparing a wonderful warm meal for friends and loved ones.

So, how can crock pot cooking help overcome the heat? To put it simply, that the crock pot in and of itself sets off a lot less heat compared to cooking than an oven or stove top. Here is the very first and maybe the best reason to utilize the crock pot in your summer meal preparation. You should also consider the fact that by not heating the house by using your stove or oven you're also avoiding your air conditioning (or alternative heating methods) from working overtime to be able to compensate for the additional heat which other cooking systems introduce.

This leaves crock pot cooking a win-win scenario since the costs involved with operating a crock pot are far less compared to the costs involved in operating a stove or oven in general. Whether electric or gas, your stove and oven tend to be significant energy hogs. Add to that the fact that you are not increasing the temperature in your home by conventional means of cooking and you're using even less power.

Unfortunately for most, the general consensus was that crock pots were intended for comfort foods and hearty winter foods.  The simple truth is that the crock pot should be one of the most loved and most frequently utilized cooking techniques if you can handle it. When it comes to cooking with a crock pot, the choices are almost limitless.  Virtually anything that can be baked can be created in the crock pot and many, many more wonderful and enticing meals and snacks as well.

Benefits of Crock Pot Cooking

Besides the cost advantages cited previously when it comes to crock pot cooking there are quite a few other advantages which are well worth mentioning. First of all, the bulk of the work entailed in crock pot cooking occurs early in the day when you're refreshed rather than at the end of a hectic work or play day. This means that you are less inclined to forget an ingredient or make other errors that frequently happen as we prepare a dinner when we are tired from the actions of daily.

Second, many good crock pot recipes include the vegetables that guarantee we are getting the nutrients that we need. So frequently, when planning a meal in the last minute, vegetables and other side dishes are made in favour of expedience. Crock pot cooking in many instances is really a meal in 1 dish.

One other terrific reason to use a crock pot for the summertime cooking is the ease of clean up.  Unlike pans and pans, most crock pot dishes are created in 1 dish. This means that there won't be mountains of meals to be either hand washed or loaded to the dishwasher (or in case you are like me-both) afterwards. You're able to spend less time cleaning just as you spent less time slaving over a hot stove. Oh wait! Make that time slaving over a hot cooker. Once clean up is complete you can get back to enjoying the sunshine set, pursuing the lightening bugs with your little ones, or waiting for your very first celebrity.

While there will be no 1 size fits all very best cooking method, crock pot cooking comes very close. When you have a crock pot collecting dust somewhere in the rear of your pantry it is time to get it out, dust in the offand dig some great summertime crock pot cooking recipes.

Sometimes I really just want to make a small batch. Microwave Nutella Mug Cake: This is delicious! It doesn&#39;t have that awful spongy texture you find in most mug cakes lately. This one is fluffy and springy at the touch. But this mug cake avoids the pitfalls of the overly-gummy microwave Dollop the Nutella on top and push in gently so it is partially submerged in the cake batter.
