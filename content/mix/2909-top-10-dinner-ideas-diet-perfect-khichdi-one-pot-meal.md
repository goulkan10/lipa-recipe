Getting A Healthy Eater

    
Camp cooking can be as complicated or simple as you would like it to be. If you wish to prepare quick and simple but healthy meals while you are swimming, camp cooking does not even need to require a flame. But if you are interested in fueling your camping excursion using a feast, then camp cooking can allow you to make warm, healthy foods that are as good as you can create them at home in your own kitchen.

Camp cooking doesn't have to be limited to sandwiches and baked potatoes wrapped in aluminum foil.  Almost any cooking system you are using from the kitchen can be replicated around the campfire. For example, use a toaster or pit cooking to consume your food. You could also easily bake foods at a bowl over a grill, or boil, braise and roast. Which sort of camping cookware is best for you? Camp cooking and cleanup can be easy or a hassle, and it all starts with great camping equipment.

Some pots/pans come in places that mate collectively or"nest" for storage and also let you tuck a canister of gas within them. This really comes in handy when you're looking to save room while camping.

Following are some camping things to carry with you if you are planning on preparing some meals around the campfire. These common kitchen items allow you to duplicate tasty meals when you are out of doors.


• Other of your favorite herbs and spices
• Cooking oil
• Pot holder

• Aluminum foil
• Tongs and spatula
• Cutting knives
• Cutting board
• Mixing bowl
• Paper or plastic silverware, plates and cups

If you have just a couple of campers and are looking for some very easy camp cooking, try out the simple and speedy technique of tin may cooking. All you will need is a fresh tin can -- a one gallon size may works nicely. Your source of heat can be a small campfire, or if wood burning is prohibited, a small buddy burner may work well, which can be found at sporting good stores or online. Put your meal from the tin could and simply heat the contents of your can over a fire.  This technique works great for soups, beans and poultry.

A more time-consuming pub cooking technique which also produces tasty meals is pit cooking.  It is also a excellent camp cooking system if you're using a dutch oven or cast iron cookware. Pit cooking warms your meals by heating rocks and coals that are concealed in the floor. As the rocks cool off, their emitted heat cooks the food. To pit cookfirst dig a hole that's roughly three times bigger than your own cookware. Line the pit with rocks and build a fire in the middle. Once the flame has burnt rapidly for about one hourpush the warm coals and rocks into the middle. Layer your wrapped food or covered skillets in addition to the stones and coals and put on top. After a couple of hours, you'll have some tasty camp food to relish.
