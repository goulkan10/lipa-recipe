Becoming A Healthy Eater

    
Camp cooking can be as elaborate or simple as you would like it to be. If you wish to prepare quick and simple but nutritious meals when you're camping, camp cooking doesn't even need to require a flame. But if you're thinking about ridding your camping excursion having a feast, camp cooking can allow you to earn warm, healthy foods which are as good as you can create them at home in your own kitchen.

 Almost any cooking process you use in the kitchen can be duplicated around the campfire. For instance, use a dutch oven or pit cooking to consume your meals. You can also easily fry foods at a bowl over a grill, or boil, braise and roast. Which type of camping cookware is ideal for you? Camp cooking and cleanup may be easy or a hassle, but it all starts with great camping gear.

Some pots/pans come in places that mate together or"nest" for storage and also allow you to tuck a spoonful of gas within them. This really comes in handy when you're searching to save space whilst camping.

Following are some camping things to carry with you if you're considering preparing some meals around the campfire. These common kitchen items will allow you to duplicate tasty meals as you are out of doors.


• Other your favorite herbs and spices
• Cooking oil
• Pot holder

• Aluminum foil

• Cutting knives
• Cutting board
• Mixing bowl


When you have only a few campers and are searching for some easy camp cooking, try out the simple and speedy technique of tin may cooking. All you'll need is a fresh tin can -- a 1 gallon size may works nicely. Your source of heat can be a small campfire, or when wood burning is prohibited, a little buddy burner may work nicely, which may be found at sporting good stores or online. Place your meal from the tin can and easily heat the contents of your own can over a fire. You will have a hot meal ready in seconds.  This technique works great for soups, beans and tuna fish.

A more time-consuming pub cooking technique which also produces yummy food is pit cooking. Pit cooking is excellent for items that may be wrapped in aluminum foil to be cooked.  It is also a wonderful camp cooking method if you're using a dutch oven or cast iron cookware. Pit cooking warms your meals by heating rocks and coals which are buried in the floor. As the rocks cool away, their emitted heat cooks the meals. To pit cookfirst dig a hole that is approximately three times larger than your own cookware. Line the pit with stones and build a fire in the center. Once the fire has burned rapidly for about one hour, push the hot coals and rocks into the middle. Layer your wrapped meals covered skillets on top of the stones and coals and place more on top. After a number of hours, you will have some tasty camp food to enjoy.

In the midst of this recent wintery weather. Strawberry delight is a dessert salad found in the United States, especially in the South and more rural areas of Minnesota. Strawberry delight is made from milk, whipped topping, cream cheese, strawberries and strawberry gelatin over a graham cracker crust. Pistachio and strawberry mixture prepared for Turkish delight. I just love strawberries… from my Strawberry Cobbler, and Strawberry Bread, to Fresh Strawberry Pie.
