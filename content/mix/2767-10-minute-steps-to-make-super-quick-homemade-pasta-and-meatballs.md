Or if you like just a nice rustic sauce to serve with your pasta then whilst cooking the onion add chunks of chorizo and lardons (chunks of bacon) then vegetables at the simmering stage"
- "Choose your pasta - I prefer spaghetti but the children like fusilli - you can use any pasta of your choice"
- "Drain your cooked pasta and either pour in the sauce and set it over a low heat to allow the pasta to absorb the liquids from the sauce and add the meatballs whilst stirring gently to ensure there is no sticking  or pile up your pasta, arrange your meatballs and pour over the sauce"
- "It&#39;s even better with a little fresh grated parmesan cheese either on the top of the dish or stirred into the plain pasta before serving"

<i>Before you jump to Pasta and meatballs recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about {<strong>The Basics of Being Healthy</strong>.</i>
Becoming A Healthy Eater

It is possible for people to make healthy food options even if they only have a brief period in which to prepare their foods. The first thing to understand is that it is often that healthy choices do not always mean a demand for meals that are grated. Someone can choose healthy foods that are fast and simple to prepare at home or to pick out of a takeout area. Cities frequently provide restaurant guides in their telephone books that display full-page menus suggesting what a particular restaurant or drive-thru provides. Many of these food sellers now include healthy alternatives to their usual fast-food selection.

 It has motivated the restaurants to supply other options within their hamburger choices. Hamburgers can be ordered without the bun, for instance, and fruit and yogurt are contained on the menu along with fresh cakes. Many restaurants offer salad choices either as side orders or as whole meals. Often, a salad of fresh vegetables with chopped ham, roast beef or chicken is much more appealing than regular menu items.  Salads are especially appealing in the summer months because they're lighter on the digestive tract.

Restaurants that contain foods in season cultivated by local farmers provide very healthy and affordable options.  This gives the consumer with a completely fresh selection and encourages them to go to the restaurant again.

If house preparation of meals is favored, the choices for healthy decisions improve. Seeing a local grocery store or supermarket emphasizes the amount of healthy choices which are readily available. Fresh fruits and vegetables are more diverse than ever before due to improvements in transport and preservation methods.  All sorts of cuisine may be prepared quickly due to the options of new goods instead of frozen foods. There are many choices of frozen foods as well. The demand for healthy frozen dishes and other foods has increased along with demands for greater variety in food that is frozen offerings. Any frozen food aisle in any supermarket will reveal as several healthy food alternatives and bad choices. The decision is up to the individual.

People can either opt to consume a healthy diet plan program or an unhealthy one. Time and access to healthy choices are no longer problems for someone who's attempting to eat better and wholesome foods.

For the tomato sauce: Put the onion, garlic and oregano into the processor and blitz to a pulp. Drain, reserving a little pasta water. Add the pasta and reserved water to meatball mixture, toss well to combine and serve topped with parmesan and a little extra oil. Bring the sauce to a simmer, reduce the heat and simmer gently while you make the meatballs. For the meatballs, mix together the beef, garlic and herbs along with a decent pinch of salt and pepper.
