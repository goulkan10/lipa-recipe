I am excited, grateful, and thankful to those who shared this wisdom. Kale is very easy to mix and match with Indian salads. The jowar kale palak salad is an exciting medley of jowar, kale leaves, broccoli, mushroom and other veggies and greens, laced with a lemony and spicy dressing, this salad reboots your day with its awesome blend of textures and flavours. Fry until aromatic, then add the greens, a pinch of salt, a splash of water and the peas. Add ground turmeric and saut√© until aromatic.
