Getting A Healthy Eater

    
Camp cooking can be as elaborate or simple as you want it to be. If you would like to prepare quick and easy but healthy meals when you're camping, camp cooking does not even have to require a fire. However, if you are considering fueling your camping excursion using a feast, camp cooking can make it possible for you to make warm, healthy foods which are as good as you can make them at home in your own kitchen.

Camp cooking doesn't have to be limited to sandwiches and baked potatoes wrapped in aluminum foil.  Almost any cooking system you are using in the kitchen could be duplicated around the home. For instance, use a dutch oven or pit cooking to consume your meals. You can also easily bake foods at a pan over a grill, or boil, braise and roast. Which kind of camping cookware is best for you? Camp cooking and cleanup may be easy or a hassle, but it all starts with great camping equipment.

Some pots/pans arrive in sets that mate jointly or"nest" for storage and even let you tuck a canister of fuel inside them. This really also comes in handy when you're trying to save room while camping.

Listed below are some camping things to take with you if you are considering preparing some meals around the campfire. These common kitchen items will allow you to duplicate tasty meals when you are out of doorways.


• Other your favorite herbs and spices
• Cooking oil
• Pot holder

• Aluminum foil
• Tongs and spatula
• Cutting knives
• Cutting board
• Mixing bowl
• Paper or plastic silverware, plates and cups

When you have only a couple of campers and are looking for some very easy camp cooking, try out the simple and fast technique of tin could cooking. All you will need is a fresh tin can -- a 1 gallon size can works nicely. Your source of heat can be a small campfire, or when wood burning is prohibited, a small buddy burner may work well, which can be found at sporting good stores or online. Put your meal from the tin can and just warm the contents of your own can over a fire. You'll have a hot meal ready in minutes.  This technique works great for soups, beans and tuna fish.

A more time-consuming camp cooking technique that also produces yummy meals is pit cooking. Pit cooking is wonderful for items which can be wrapped in aluminum foil to be cooked.  It's also a wonderful camp cooking method if you're using a dutch oven or cast iron cookware. Pit cooking warms your meals by heating stones and coals which are buried in the ground. As the rocks cool off, their emitted heat cooks the meals. To pit cookfirst dig a hole that is about three times bigger than your own cookware. Line the pit with stones and build a fire in the middle. Once the fire has burnt rapidly for about an hourpush the hot coals and rocks into the center. Twist your wrapped meals covered skillets on top of the stones and coals and put more on top. Following a couple of hours, you will have some delicious camp food to enjoy.

Pat the shrimps dry so the breading adheres well. My favorite breading mix is three parts flour and one part cornstarch which delivers a light yet very crispy texture. This creates a light yet crispy coating. Be sure to deep-fry the shrimp twice for extra crispiness that will stand up to the sauce. For a spicy kick, I used dried hot peppers to make chili infused oil, but you can use commercially prepared chili oil and/or fresh green/red hot peppers instead.
