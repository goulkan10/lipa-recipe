<i>Before you jump to Rice pinwheel recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about {<strong>The Basics of Being Healthy</strong>.</i>
Getting A Healthy Eater

    
Camp cooking can be as elaborate or simple as you would like it to be. If you wish to prepare fast and simple but nutritious meals as you're camping, camp cooking does not even have to need a flame. But if you are considering fueling your camping excursion having a feast, then camp cooking can enable you to make hot, healthy foods which are as great as you can make them at home in your kitchen.

Camp cooking doesn't have to be limited to sandwiches and baked potatoes wrapped in aluminum foil.  Just about any cooking method you use from the kitchen could be duplicated around the campfire. For example, use a toaster or pit cooking to bake your food. You might also easily fry foods in a pan over a grill, or boil, braise and beverage. Which type of camping cookware is ideal for you? Camp cooking and cleanup can be easy or a hassle, but it all starts with great camping gear.

Some pots/pans come in sets that mate collectively or"nest" for storage and also let you tuck a canister of gas within them. This really comes in handy once you're trying to save room whilst camping.

Following are some camping items to consider with you if you are considering preparing some meals around the campfire. These common kitchen items will allow you to replicate yummy meals when you're out of doors.


• Other your favorite herbs and spices
• Cooking oil
• Pot holder

• Aluminum foil

• Cutting knives
• Cutting board
• Mixing bowl
• Paper or plastic silverware, plates and cups

When you have just a couple campers and are searching for some very easy camp cooking, try the simple and fast technique of tin can cooking. All you will need is a clean tin can -- a 1 gallon size may works well. Your source of heat can be a little campfire, or if wood burning is illegal, a little buddy burner may work well, which can be seen at sporting good stores or online. Put your meal from the tin can and just heat the contents of your own can over a fire.  This technique works great for soups, beans and poultry.

A more time-consuming camp cooking technique which also produces yummy meals is pit cooking. Pit cooking is excellent for items which can be wrapped in aluminum foil to be cooked.  It's also a excellent camp cooking system if you are using a dutch oven or cast iron cookware. Pit cooking warms your meals by heating rocks and coals that are buried in the ground. As the stones cool away, their emitted heat cooks the meals. To pit cook, first dig a hole that's about three times bigger than your cookware. Line the pit with stones and create a fire in the middle. Once the fire has burned rapidly for approximately an hour, push the hot coals and rocks into the middle. Layer your wrapped meals or covered skillets on top of the stones and coals and put on top. Following a few hours, you will have some delicious camp food to enjoy.
