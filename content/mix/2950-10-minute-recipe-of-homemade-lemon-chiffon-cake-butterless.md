 Unlike vegetables and pans, many crock pot dishes are created in one dish. This usually means that there is not going to be mountains of meals to be either hand washed or loaded to the dishwasher (or if you're like me-both) afterwards. You can spend less time cleaning just as you spent less time slaving over a hot cooker. Oh wait! Make that time slaving over a hot cooker.
