<i>Before you jump to Mini Egg Biscuit recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about {<strong>The Simple Ways to Be Healthy</strong>.</i>
Getting A Healthy Eater

It's possible for people to make healthy food choices even when they only have a short time in which to prepare their own meals. The very first point to see is that it is often that healthy alternatives don't always mean a need for two-hour meals. Someone could pick healthy foods that are quick and easy to prepare in your home or to pickup from a takeout area. Cities often provide restaurant guides in their telephone books that display full-page menus indicating what a particular restaurant or drive-thru provides. Many of these food vendors now include healthy alternatives to their regular fast-food choice.

 This has motivated the restaurants to supply different options within their hamburger choices. Hamburgers could be ordered without the bun, for instance, and fruit and yogurt are contained on the menu together with fresh salads. Many restaurants provide salad choices either as unwanted orders or as total meals.  Salads are especially attractive in the summer months because they are milder on the digestive tract.

Restaurants that contain foods in year cultivated by local farmers offer very healthy and affordable choices. Some of such restaurants will make their own recipes for healthy food options.  This gives the customer with a totally fresh choice and promotes them to go to the restaurant again.

If home preparation of meals is preferred, the alternatives for healthy choices grow. Visiting a local grocery store or supermarket emphasizes the amount of healthy choices which are available. Fresh fruits and vegetables are more varied than ever before due to improvements in transportation and preservation methods.  All sorts of cuisine can be ready quickly because of the options of fresh goods rather than frozen foods. There are numerous choices of frozen foods also. The demand for healthy frozen dinners and other meals has increased along with demands for much more variety in food that is frozen supplies. Any frozen food aisle at any supermarket will show as lots of healthy food options and poor choices. The choice is all left up to the person.

People may either choose to eat a healthy diet plan or an unhealthy one. Time and availability of healthy options are no longer problems for someone who is attempting to eat better and healthier foods.


<i>We hope you got insight from reading it, now let's go back to mini egg biscuit recipe. You can cook mini egg biscuit using <strong>4</strong> ingredients and <strong>6</strong> steps. Here is how you achieve that.
</i>

##### The ingredients needed to cook Mini Egg Biscuit:

1. Provide 60 g (3 tbsp) sweetened condensed milk
1. You need 37 g (2 qty) medium egg yolks
1. Get 42 g (3 tbsp) unsalted butter, room temperature
1. Use 110-130 g (12-14 tbsp) potato starch or corn starch


##### Instructions to make Mini Egg Biscuit:

1. Youtu.be/L9NWA1J7aMI
1. In a medium bowl, mix together milk, yolks, and butter thoroughly.
1. Add 110 grams of starch and mix until well-combined and smooth. Add more starch if the dough is still sticky and too wet.
1. Portion the dough into small balls. I used a measuring spoon of ¼ teaspoon to scoop and portion each ball.
1. For oven-baking, place them 1-inch apart on a baking tray lined with parchment paper. For stovetop cooking, place them on a heavy-bottom frying pan, also 1-inch apart.
1. Bake in a preheated oven at 320°F or 160°C for 17-20 minutes or until the bottom of the biscuit is golden brown. For stovetop cooking, cover the pan with a lid and cook over low heat. Check the bottom of the biscuit every 5 minutes. It takes about 20 minutes for the biscuit to be browned at the bottom and become solid.


Add in the Flour and beat again till a biscuit dough is formed! Fold through/press in the Crushed Mini Eggs and then press into the bottom of the tin. Once baked, leave to cool on the side, but still in the tin. Mix it first with a spoon, then get your hands in and squeeze into a firm dough. Tip in the flour, bicarb and a pinch of salt, then use a spatula to mix together before adding the chocolate chunks and about half the crushed mini eggs (set aside the larger pieces) and mix again until everything is combined.
