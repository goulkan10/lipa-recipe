<i>Before you jump to Homemade strawberry ice cream recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about {<strong>The Simple Ways to Be Healthy</strong>.</i>
Becoming A Healthy Eater

    
Camp cooking can be as elaborate or simple as you want it to be. If you would like to prepare quick and easy but healthy meals when you are camping, camp cooking does not even need to require a fire. But if you're interested in fueling your camping trip using a feast, then camp cooking can allow you to make hot, healthy foods which are as great as you can make them at home in your kitchen.

 Almost any cooking process you are using from the kitchen can be duplicated around the campfire. For instance, use a toaster or pit cooking to bake your meals. You might also easily fry foods in a bowl over a grill, or boil, braise and roast. What type of camping cookware is ideal for you? Camp cooking and clean-up may be easy or a hassle, but it all starts with great camping equipment.

Some pots/pans come in sets that mate collectively or"nest" for storage and even let you tuck a canister of fuel inside them. This comes in handy once you're wanting to save space whilst camping.

Listed below are some camping items to take with you if you are thinking about preparing some meals around the home. These common kitchen items allow you to duplicate tasty meals as you're out of doors.


• Other of your favourite herbs and spices
• Cooking oil
• Pot holder

• Aluminum foil
• Tongs and spatula
• Cutting knives
• Cutting board
• Mixing bowl


In case you have only a couple campers and are looking for some simple camp cooking, try out the easy and speedy technique of tin may cooking. All you will need is a fresh tin can -- a one gallon size can works well. Your source of warmth can be a little campfire, or when wood burning is illegal, a little buddy burner may work well, which can be located at sporting good stores or online. Place your meal from the tin can and just heat the contents of your can over a flame. You'll have a hot meal ready in seconds.  This technique works great for sauces, beans and tuna fish.

A more time-consuming camp cooking technique which also produces tasty meals is pit cooking. Pit cooking is excellent for items which may be wrapped in aluminum foil to be cooked.  It's also a great camp cooking system if you are using a dutch oven or cast iron cookware. Pit cooking calms your meals by heating stones and coals that are buried in the floor. As the rocks cool off, their emitted heat cooks the food. To pit cookfirst dig a hole that's roughly three times larger than your own cookware. Line the pit with stones and construct a fire in the middle. When the flame has burnt rapidly for approximately an hourpush the warm coals and stones into the middle. Twist your wrapped meals or covered skillets in addition to the rocks and coals and place more on top. After a number of hours, you will have some tasty camp food to enjoy.
