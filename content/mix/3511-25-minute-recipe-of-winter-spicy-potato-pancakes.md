Whether electric or gas, your stove and oven are often serious energy hogs. Add to this the fact that you are not increasing the warmth in your house by traditional way of cooking and you're using even less power.

Unfortunately for many, the general consensus has been that crock pots were intended for comfort foods and hearty winter meals.

Second, many good crock pot recipes incorporate the vegetables that insure we are getting the nutrients we need. So often, when preparing a meal at the last minute, vegetables and other side dishes are left out in favor of expedience. Crock pot cooking many instances is really a meal in 1 dish.

One other terrific reason to use a crock pot for the summertime cooking is that the ease of clean up.  Unlike vegetables and pans, many crock pot dishes are created in 1 dish. This usually means that there is not going to be mountains of dishes to be either hand cleaned or packed into the dishwasher (or if you are like me-both) afterwards. It's possible to spend less time cleaning just as you spent less time slaving over a hot cooker. Oh wait! Ensure time slaving over a hot stove. After clean up is complete you can get back to enjoying the sunshine set, pursuing the lightening bugs with your little ones, or even waiting for your first celebrity.

While there will be no one size fits all very ideal cooking system, crock pot cooking comes very near. When you have a crock pot collecting dust somewhere at the back of your pantry it's time to get it out, dust off, and dig up some excellent summer crock pot cooking recipes.
