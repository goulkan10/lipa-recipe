<i>Before you jump to Koong Chae Nampla / Shrimps with hot sauce recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about {<strong>The Basics of Being Healthy</strong>.</i>
Getting A Healthy Eater

    
Camp cooking can be as complicated or simple as you want it to be. If you would like to prepare quick and easy but nutritious meals as you are swimming, camp cooking does not even need to need a fire. But if you are interested in ridding your camping trip having a feast, camp cooking can make it possible for you to earn warm, healthy foods that are as good as you can create them at home in your own kitchen.

Camp cooking does not have to be limited to sandwiches and baked potatoes wrapped in aluminum foil.  Just about any cooking method you use in the kitchen could be duplicated around the campfire. For instance, use a dutch oven or pit cooking to bake your meals. You might also easily bake foods at a bowl over a grill, or boil, braise and beverage. What sort of camping cookware is ideal for you? Camp cooking and clean-up can be easy or a hassle, and it all starts with great camping equipment.

Some pots/pans arrive in sets that mate together or"nest" for storage and even allow you to tuck a canister of gas within them. This really comes in handy when you're wanting to save space whilst camping.

Listed below are some camping items to consider with you if you're thinking about preparing some meals around the campfire. These common kitchen items allow you to duplicate tasty meals when you are out of doorways.


• Other your favorite herbs and spices
• Cooking oil
• Pot holder

• Aluminum foil

• Cutting knives
• Cutting board
• Mixing bowl
• Paper or plastic silverware, plates and cups

In case you have only a couple campers and are looking for some easy camp cooking, try the simple and quick technique of tin can cooking. All you'll need is a fresh tin can -- a 1 gallon size can works nicely. Your source of warmth may be small campfire, or if wood burning is illegal, a small buddy burner may work nicely, which can be found at sporting good stores or online. Put your meal from the tin can and just heat the contents of your own can over a flame. You'll have a hot meal ready in minutes.  This technique works great for sauces, beans and tuna fish.

A more time-consuming camp cooking technique that also produces delectable meals is pit cooking. Pit cooking is terrific for items which may be wrapped in aluminum foil to be cooked.  It's also a excellent camp cooking method if you are using a dutch oven or cast iron cookware. Pit cooking calms your meals by heating rocks and coals that are concealed in the floor. As the stones cool away, their emitted heat cooks the meals. To pit cook, first dig a hole that's approximately three times larger than your cookware. Line the pit with stones and create a fire in the center. Once the flame has burnt rapidly for approximately an hour, push the hot coals and rocks into the middle. Twist your wrapped meals or covered skillets in addition to the stones and coals and place on top. After a couple of hours, you'll have some tasty camp food to enjoy.
