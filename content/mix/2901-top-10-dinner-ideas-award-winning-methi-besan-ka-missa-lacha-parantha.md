This is the very first and possibly the very best reason to use the crock pot in summer time meal preparation. You should also consider that by not heating the house by employing your stove or oven you are also preventing your air conditioning (or additional cooling systems ) from working overtime to be able to compensate for the additional heat that other cooking methods pose.

This makes crock pot cooking a win-win situation since the costs involved in operating a crock pot are much less compared to the costs involved in managing a stove or oven in general. Whether gas or electric, your cooker and oven are often significant energy hogs. Add to that the fact that you're not raising the warmth in your home by conventional way of cooking and you are using less electricity.

Second, many good crock pot recipes incorporate the vegetables that insure we are getting the nutrients we need. So often, when planning a meal at the last minute, vegetables and other side dishes are left out in favour of expedience. Crock pot cooking in many cases is really a meal in one dish.

One other wonderful reason to use a crock pot for your summer cooking is that the ease of clean up.  Unlike vegetables and pans, most crock pot foods are made in one dish. This means that there won't be mountains of dishes to be hand washed or loaded into the dishwasher (or in case you are like me-both) afterwards. You can spend less time cleaning as you spent time slaving over a hot cooker. Oh wait! Make that time slaving over a hot stove. Once tidy is complete you can contact enjoying the sunshine set, pursuing the lightening bugs with your small ones, or waiting for the very first superstar.

While there'll never be a one size fits all very best cooking procedure, crock pot cooking comes very close. When you've got a crock pot collecting dust somewhere in the back of your pantry it's the right time to get out it, dust in the off, and dig some terrific summer crock pot cooking recipes.
