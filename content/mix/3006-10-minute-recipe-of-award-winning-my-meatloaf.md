So good to know that worked well, Rhoda! Making meatloaf with super-lean meat, like ground chicken or ground turkey, can be tricky. Because of the minimal fat content, the meat easily dries out. Follow this tip: Consider using a meat blend. Any combination of beef, veal, pork, or lamb works really well.
