It&#39;s more common in South India but now I see it just as much everywhere in India. My mom always said, upma is the savory version of sooji halwa, whhich is true in a way. They are both made with sooji and water. Chilli idli, Idli fry, Idli manchurian, Masala idli, Kheema Idli are the most common ways to use up left overs. This can be enjoyed for a evening snack or quick breakfast.
