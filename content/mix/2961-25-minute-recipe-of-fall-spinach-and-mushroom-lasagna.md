Getting A Healthy Eater

    
Camp cooking can be as elaborate or simple as you want it to be. If you would like to prepare quick and simple but healthy meals when you're swimming, camp cooking doesn't even need to require a fire. But if you're interested in ridding your camping trip using a feast, camp cooking can make it possible for you to earn hot, healthy foods that are as good as you can make them at home in your own kitchen.

Camp cooking doesn't need to be limited to sandwiches and baked potatoes wrapped in aluminum foil.  Almost any cooking process you use from the kitchen could be duplicated around the campfire. For instance, use a dutch oven or pit cooking to bake your meals. You may also easily bake foods in a bowl over a grill, or boil, braise and beverage. What kind of camping cookware is ideal for you? Camp cooking and cleanup may be easy or a hassle, but it all starts with great camping gear.

Some pots/pans come in places that mate jointly or"nest" for storage and also allow you to tuck a canister of gas within them. This really comes in handy once you're wanting to save space while camping.

Following are some camping items to take with you if you are planning on preparing some meals around the campfire. These frequent kitchen items will allow you to duplicate tasty meals as you're out of doorways.


• Other of your favourite herbs and spices
• Cooking oil
• Pot holder
• Hand-held can opener
• Aluminum foil

• Cutting knives
• Cutting board
• Mixing bowl


In case you have only a few campers and are searching for some simple camp cooking, try the easy and quick technique of tin can cooking. All you'll need is a clean tin can -- a 1 gallon size can works nicely. Your source of heat may be little campfire, or if wood burning is prohibited, a little buddy burner may work well, which may be seen at sporting good stores or online. Place your meal in the tin can and just warm the contents of your own can over a fire. You will have a hot meal ready in minutes.  This technique works great for soups, beans and poultry.

A more time-consuming pub cooking technique which also produces tasty meals is pit cooking.  It is also a wonderful camp cooking method if you are using a dutch oven or cast iron cookware. Pit cooking calms your meals by heating rocks and coals that are buried in the floor. As the rocks cool , their emitted heat cooks the food. To pit cook, first dig a hole that's about three times bigger than your cookware. Line the pit with stones and build a fire in the center. When the flame has burnt rapidly for about an hour, push the hot coals and stones into the middle. Twist your wrapped meals or covered skillets in addition to the stones and coals and put on top. After a few hours, you'll have some tasty camp food to relish.
