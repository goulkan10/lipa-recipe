This means that there won't be mountains of dishes to be hand washed or packed into the dishwasher (or in case you're like me-both) afterwards. You can spend less time cleaning as you spent time slaving over a hot stove. Oh wait! Ensure time slaving over a hot stove. Once tidy is complete you can contact enjoying the sunshine set, chasing the lightening bugs with your little ones, or even waiting for the first celebrity.
