This is the first and maybe the best reason to utilize the crock pot in your summer meal planning. You should also look at that by not heating the home by using your stove or oven you are also avoiding your air conditioning (or additional cooling systems ) from working overtime to be able to compensate for the extra heat that other cooking systems pose.

Whether electric or gas, your cooker and oven are often significant energy hogs. Add to that the fact that you are not increasing the temperature in your home by conventional way of cooking and you are using even less electricity.

Unfortunately for most, the general consensus has been the crock pots were meant for comfort foods and hearty winter meals.

Second, many great crock pot recipes include the vegetables that insure we're getting the nutrients we need. So frequently, when preparing a meal at the last moment, vegetables and other side dishes are made in favour of expedience. Crock pot cooking many cases is a meal in 1 dish.

One other excellent reason to use a crock pot for the summer cooking is that the ease of clean up.  Unlike vegetables and pans, many crock pot foods are made in one dish. This means that there won't be mountains of dishes to be hand washed or packed to the dishwasher (or if you are like me-both) later. You're able to spend less time cleaning only as you spent time slaving over a hot stove. Oh wait! Make that time slaving over a hot stove. Once tidy is complete you can contact enjoying the sunshine set, chasing the lightening bugs along with your little ones, or even waiting for the first superstar.

While there will never be a 1 size fits all very ideal cooking process, crock pot cooking comes very near. When you have a crock pot collecting dust somewhere at the rear of your pantry it's the right time to get it out, dust off, and dig up some wonderful summertime crock pot cooking recipes.
