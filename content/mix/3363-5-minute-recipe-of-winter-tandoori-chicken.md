A more time-consuming pub cooking technique that also produces yummy food is pit cooking.  It's also a excellent camp cooking system if you are using a dutch oven or cast iron cookware. Pit cooking warms your meals by heating rocks and coals which are concealed in the floor. As the rocks cool away, their emitted heat cooks the food. To pit cookfirst dig a hole that is about three times larger than your own cookware. Line the pit with rocks and construct a fire in the center. Once the flame has burnt rapidly for about an hour, push the warm coals and stone into the middle. Layer your wrapped food or covered skillets on top of the rocks and coals and place more on top. Following a few hours, you'll have some delicious camp food to relish.
