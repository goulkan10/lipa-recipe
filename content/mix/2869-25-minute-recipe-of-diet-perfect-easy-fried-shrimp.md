Becoming A Healthy Eater

    
Camp cooking can be as complicated or simple as you would like it to be. If you would like to prepare quick and simple but nutritious meals when you are swimming, camp cooking doesn't even need to require a flame. But if you are considering ridding your camping trip using a feast, camp cooking can enable you to make hot, healthy foods that are as good as you can create them at home in your kitchen.

Camp cooking does not have to be limited to sandwiches and baked potatoes wrapped in aluminum foil.  Almost any cooking process you use in the kitchen can be replicated around the campfire. For instance, use a dutch oven or pit cooking to bake your meals. You might also easily bake foods at a pan over a grill, or boil, braise and beverage. Which sort of camping cookware is best for you? Camp cooking and clean-up can be easy or a hassle, it all starts with great camping gear.

Some pots/pans arrive in sets that partner collectively or"nest" for storage and even let you tuck a canister of fuel inside them. This comes in handy once you're trying to save space whilst camping.

Following are some camping items to carry with you if you are planning on preparing some meals around the campfire. These common kitchen items will allow you to replicate yummy meals while you are out of doors.

• Salt and pepper
• Other your favorite herbs and spices
• Cooking oil
• Pot holder
• Hand-held can opener
• Aluminum foil

• Cutting knives
• Cutting board
• Mixing bowl


In case you have only a couple of campers and are looking for some very easy camp cooking, try the easy and quick technique of tin can cooking. All you'll need is a fresh tin can -- a 1 gallon size may works well. Your source of warmth may be small campfire, or when wood burning is prohibited, a little buddy burner will work well, which may be found at sporting good stores or online. Place your meal in the tin could and just heat the contents of your own can over a fire. You will have a hot meal ready in minutes.  This technique works great for sauces, beans and tuna fish.

A more time-consuming camp cooking technique that also produces tasty food is pit cooking. Pit cooking is wonderful for items which could be wrapped in aluminum foil to be cooked.  It is also a excellent camp cooking method if you're using a dutch oven or cast iron cookware. Pit cooking warms your food by heating stones and coals that are concealed in the ground. As the stones cool off, their emitted heat cooks the food. To pit cookfirst dig a hole that is approximately three times bigger than your own cookware. Line the pit with rocks and construct a fire in the middle. When the fire has burnt rapidly for about one hourpush the warm coals and rocks into the center. Twist your wrapped food or covered skillets in addition to the rocks and coals and put on top. Following a number of hours, you'll have some tasty camp food to relish.
