<i>Before you jump to Easy Crockpot Spaghetti Squash &amp; Meatballs recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about {<strong>The Basics of Being Healthy</strong>.</i>
Getting A Healthy Eater

It's possible for people to make healthy food choices even if they only have a short period in which to prepare their own meals. The first point to see is that it is often that healthy choices don't always signify a demand for meals that are aerated. A person can choose healthy foods that are fast and easy to prepare at home or to pickup from a takeout location. Cities often provide restaurant guides within their telephone books that show full-page menus indicating what a specific restaurant or drive-thru offers. A number of these food vendors now include healthy alternatives for their usual fast-food selection.

 It has prompted the restaurants to give different options within their burger choices. Hamburgers can be ordered with no bun, for instance, and fruit and yogurt are contained on the menu together with fresh cakes. Many restaurants offer salad choices either as side orders or as whole meals. Many times, a salad of fresh vegetables with sliced ham, roast beef or poultry is more appealing than regular menu items.  Salads are particularly attractive in the summertime as they are milder on the digestive system.

Restaurants that feature foods in season cultivated by local farmers provide very healthy and affordable choices.  This provides the customer with a completely fresh selection and encourages them to visit the restaurant .

If home preparation of meals is favored, the options for healthy choices increase. Visiting a neighborhood grocery store or supermarket highlights the amount of healthy choices that are readily available.  All types of cuisine can be ready quickly due to the choices of new goods instead of frozen foods. There are many options of frozen foods also. The demand for healthy frozen dinners and other meals has increased along with demands for more variety in frozen food offerings. Any frozen food aisle at any supermarket will reveal as many healthy food alternatives and bad choices. The choice is up to the individual.

People can either decide to eat a healthy diet plan or an unhealthy one. Time and access to healthy choices are no longer problems for someone who is trying to eat better and wholesome foods.

##### The ingredients needed to cook Easy Crockpot Spaghetti Squash &amp; Meatballs:

1. Take 1 packages Frozen meatballs
1. You need 1 packages (Jar) of spaghetti sauce (we like Newmans sauce).
1. Get 1 each Spaghetti squash-cut in half


##### Steps to make Easy Crockpot Spaghetti Squash &amp; Meatballs:

1. Spray crock pot with non-stick cooking spray.
1. Cut squash in half and take out the seeds. Place both halves side by side in crock pot with the cut side down.

Place the spaghetti squash cut side down into the crock pot, then pour in a jar of your favorite spaghetti sauce. I used just one, but if you like it extra saucy, feel free to use more. Rinse off your spaghetti squash, and set it in the bowl of your slow cooker. Add one cup of water to the bottom of the slow cooker. Remove from the slow cooker, and place on a cutting board.
