Becoming A Healthy Eater

    
Camp cooking can be as complicated or simple as you want it to be. If you want to prepare fast and simple but nutritious meals as you're camping, camp cooking does not even need to need a flame. But if you are interested in fueling your camping trip using a feast, camp cooking can enable you to make hot, healthy foods which are as good as you can make them at home in your own kitchen.

Camp cooking does not have to be limited to sandwiches and baked potatoes wrapped in aluminum foil.  Just about any cooking process you use in the kitchen could be replicated around the home. For example, use a toaster or pit cooking to bake your meals. You can also easily bake foods at a pan over a grill, or boil, braise and beverage. Which kind of camping cookware is best for you? Camp cooking and cleanup can be easy or a hassle, but it all starts with great camping gear.

Some pots/pans come in sets that mate together or"nest" for storage and also allow you to tuck a spoonful of fuel inside them. This comes in handy when you're looking to save space while camping.

Following are some camping items to take with you if you are thinking about preparing some meals around the campfire. These common kitchen items allow you to duplicate tasty meals as you are out of doors.


• Other of your favorite herbs and spices
• Cooking oil
• Pot holder

• Aluminum foil

• Cutting knives
• Cutting board
• Mixing bowl
• Paper or plastic silverware, plates and cups

In case you have only a couple of campers and are looking for some simple camp cooking, try out the easy and quick technique of tin could cooking. All you will need is a clean tin can -- a 1 gallon size may works well. Your source of heat can be a small campfire, or if wood burning is prohibited, a little buddy burner may work nicely, which may be found at sporting good stores or online. Place your meal from the tin could and simply heat the contents of your own can over a fire. You'll have a hot meal ready in seconds.  This technique works great for sauces, beans and tuna fish.

A more time-consuming camp cooking technique that also produces tasty food is pit cooking. Pit cooking is fantastic for items that could be wrapped in aluminum foil to be cooked.  It is also a great camp cooking system if you are using a dutch oven or cast iron cookware. Pit cooking calms your meals by heating stones and coals which are buried in the ground. As the stones cool off, their emitted heat cooks the food. To pit cook, first dig a hole that is approximately three times bigger than your cookware. Line the pit with rocks and construct a fire in the center. When the flame has burnt rapidly for approximately one hourpush the hot coals and stones into the middle. Layer your wrapped food covered skillets on top of the stones and coals and put on top. Following a couple of hours, you will have some tasty camp food to enjoy.

The grating is usually done by hand and traditionally with a rosti grater with large holes, but a box grater will do nicely. A rösti cooked from raw potatoes. The raw potato rösti looks far more like my image of the dish - the strands of potato are still distinct and it&#39;s ragged For some Swiss, it&#39;s not enough to parboil the potatoes - they must be done a day in advance and chilled before grating. Rösti is a traditional Swiss potato pancake typically served as a side dish but we added ham and cheese to transform it into an easy weeknight supper. Enjoy with steamed asparagus and chunky applesauce on the side.
