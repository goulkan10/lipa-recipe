Becoming A Healthy Eater

    
Camp cooking can be as complicated or simple as you want it to be. If you wish to prepare quick and simple but healthy meals when you are camping, camp cooking doesn't even have to need a fire. However, if you are thinking about fueling your camping trip with a feast, then camp cooking can enable you to earn warm, healthy foods that are as great as you can create them at home in your kitchen.

 Almost any cooking method you are using from the kitchen can be replicated around the campfire. For instance, use a toaster or pit cooking to bake your food. You might also easily fry foods in a pan over a grill, or boil, braise and roast. What type of camping cookware is ideal for you? Camp cooking and cleanup may be easy or a hassle, and it all starts with great camping gear.

Some pots/pans come in sets that mate together or"nest" for storage and also let you tuck a canister of fuel inside them. This comes in handy when you're wanting to save room while camping.

Following are some camping items to carry with you if you're thinking about preparing some meals around the home. These common kitchen items allow you to replicate yummy meals as you are out of doorways.

• Salt and pepper
• Other of your favourite herbs and spices
• Cooking oil
• Pot holder
• Hand-held can opener
• Aluminum foil
• Tongs and spatula
• Cutting knives
• Cutting board
• Mixing bowl


If you have just a couple campers and are looking for some simple camp cooking, try the easy and quick technique of tin may cooking. All you'll need is a clean tin can -- a one gallon size may works well. Your source of heat may be small campfire, or when wood burning is prohibited, a little buddy burner will work nicely, which can be located at sporting good stores or online. Place your meal in the tin can and easily warm the contents of your own can over a flame.  This technique works great for soups, beans and tuna fish.

A more time-consuming pub cooking technique that also produces delectable meals is pit cooking. Pit cooking is very good for items which can be wrapped in aluminum foil to be cooked.  It's also a wonderful camp cooking method if you are using a dutch oven or cast iron cookware. Pit cooking warms your food by heating rocks and coals which are buried in the floor. As the stones cool , their emitted heat cooks the meals. To pit cookfirst dig a hole that is about three times bigger than your cookware. Line the pit with stones and build a fire in the center. Once the flame has burnt rapidly for approximately one hourpush the hot coals and stone into the center. Layer your wrapped meals covered skillets on top of the stones and coals and place on top. Following a couple of hours, you will have some tasty camp food to enjoy.
