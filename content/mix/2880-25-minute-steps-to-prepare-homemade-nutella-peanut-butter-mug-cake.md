<i>Before you jump to Nutella Peanut Butter Mug Cake recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about {<strong>The Basics of Being Healthy</strong>.</i>
Getting A Healthy Eater

    
Camp cooking can be as complicated or simple as you would like it to be. If you would like to prepare quick and simple but healthy meals while you're swimming, camp cooking doesn't even need to need a fire. But if you are interested in fueling your camping excursion having a feast, then camp cooking can enable you to make hot, healthy foods which are as good as you can create them at home in your own kitchen.

 Just about any cooking procedure you use from the kitchen could be duplicated around the campfire. For example, use a dutch oven or pit cooking to consume your meals. You may also easily bake foods at a pan over a grill, or boil, braise and beverage. Which sort of camping cookware is best for you? Camp cooking and clean-up can be easy or a hassle, but it all starts with great camping gear.

Some pots/pans arrive in sets that mate collectively or"nest" for storage and even let you tuck a canister of gas within them. This comes in handy once you're looking to save space whilst camping.

Following are some camping items to consider with you if you are considering preparing some meals around the home. These common kitchen items will allow you to duplicate tasty meals while you're out of doorways.

• Salt and pepper
• Other of your favourite herbs and spices
• Cooking oil
• Pot holder

• Aluminum foil

• Cutting knives
• Cutting board
• Mixing bowl
• Paper or plastic silverware, plates and cups

In case you have just a couple campers and are looking for some easy camp cooking, try the easy and speedy technique of tin can cooking. All you'll need is a fresh tin can -- a one gallon size may works nicely. Your source of warmth may be little campfire, or if wood burning is illegal, a little buddy burner may work nicely, which may be located at sporting good stores or online. Place your meal in the tin can and just heat the contents of your own can over a flame.  This technique works great for sauces, beans and tuna fish.

A more time-consuming camp cooking technique that also produces tasty food is pit cooking.  It is also a excellent camp cooking method if you're using a dutch oven or cast iron cookware. Pit cooking warms your meals by heating rocks and coals that are concealed in the floor. As the stones cool off, their emitted heat cooks the meals. To pit cook, first dig a hole that is approximately three times larger than your cookware. Line the pit with rocks and construct a fire in the center. When the fire has burnt rapidly for about one hourpush the hot coals and rocks into the center. Layer your wrapped meals or covered skillets on top of the stones and coals and place on top. After a few hours, you will have some tasty camp food to enjoy.

Microwaves vary, so the cooking time may vary too. This fudgy, gooey Nutella Mug Cake is somewhere in between a warm brownie and slice of your favorite chocolate cake. Because every peanut butter brand is different, you may have to play with the amount of sugar you add. Lucky for me, I have recently discovered mug cakes which are the perfect solo cake treat! Last night I got a chocolate / peanut butter / all things bad craving so I tested out a new recipe I found online with three other friends.
