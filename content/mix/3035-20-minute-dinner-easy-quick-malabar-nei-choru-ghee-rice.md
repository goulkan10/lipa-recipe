Here is the very first and possibly the very best reason to use the crock pot in summer time meal planning. You should also look at the fact that by not heating your home by employing your stove top or oven you're also preventing your air conditioning (or other cooling methods) from working overtime in order to compensate for the extra heat that other cooking systems pose.

This leaves crock pot cooking a win-win situation since the costs involved with operating a crock pot are much less compared to the costs involved in operating a stove or oven generally. Whether gas or electric, your stove and oven are often serious energy hogs. Add to that the fact that you are not increasing the warmth in your house by traditional way of cooking and you're using less energy.

Secondly, many great crock pot recipes include the vegetables that guarantee we're getting the nutrients that we need. So often, when preparing a meal in the last moment, vegetables and other side dishes are left out in favor of expedience. Crock pot cooking in many cases is a meal in one dish.

 Unlike pans and pans, most crock pot meals are created in 1 dish. This means that there is not going to be mountains of dishes to be hand washed or packed to the dishwasher (or in case you are like me-both) later. You can spend less time cleaning just as you spent time slaving over a hot stove. Oh wait! Ensure no time slaving over a hot cooker. After tidy is complete you can get back to enjoying the sunshine set, chasing the lightening bugs with your small ones, or waiting for the first star.
