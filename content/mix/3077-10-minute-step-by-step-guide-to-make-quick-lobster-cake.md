 Unlike pans and pans, most crock pot meals are created in one dish. This means that there will not be mountains of dishes to be hand washed or packed into the dishwasher (or in case you are like me-both) later. You're able to spend less time cleaning only as you spent time slaving over a hot stove. Oh wait! Make that time slaving over a hot stove. Once tidy is complete you can contact enjoying the sun set, chasing the lightening bugs along with your small ones, or even waiting for your first celebrity.

While there will be no 1 size fits all ideal cooking method, crock pot cooking comes really close. When you have a crock pot gathering dust somewhere at the rear of your pantry it's time to get out it, dust off, and dig up some fantastic summer crock pot cooking recipes.
