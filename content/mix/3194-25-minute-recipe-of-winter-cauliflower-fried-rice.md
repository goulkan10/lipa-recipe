Becoming A Healthy Eater

    
Camp cooking can be as complicated or simple as you would like it to be. If you want to prepare fast and easy but nutritious meals as you're camping, camp cooking doesn't even need to require a fire. But if you're thinking about fueling your camping trip with a feast, then camp cooking can allow you to earn warm, healthy foods which are as great as you can create them at home in your own kitchen.

Camp cooking doesn't need to be limited to sandwiches and baked potatoes wrapped in aluminum foil.  Just about any cooking system you are using in the kitchen could be duplicated around the home. For instance, use a dutch oven or pit cooking to bake your meals. You might also easily fry foods in a pan over a grill, or boil, braise and roast. Which sort of camping cookware is ideal for you? Camp cooking and cleanup can be easy or a hassle, and it all starts with great camping gear.

Some pots/pans arrive in sets that mate jointly or"nest" for storage and even allow you to tuck a spoonful of gas within them. This also comes in handy when you're searching to save room while camping.

Following are some camping things to consider with you if you are planning on preparing some meals around the home. These frequent kitchen items allow you to duplicate tasty meals while you're out of doorways.


• Other of your favourite herbs and spices
• Cooking oil
• Pot holder
• Hand-held can opener
• Aluminum foil

• Cutting knives
• Cutting board
• Mixing bowl
• Paper or plastic silverware, plates and cups

In case you have only a couple campers and are searching for some simple camp cooking, try the easy and speedy technique of tin may cooking. All you will need is a clean tin can -- a one gallon size may works well. Your source of heat can be a small campfire, or when wood burning is illegal, a little buddy burner may work well, which may be located at sporting good stores or online. Put your meal from the tin could and just heat the contents of your own can over a fire. You'll have a hot meal ready in minutes.  This technique works great for sauces, beans and tuna fish.

A more time-consuming pub cooking technique which also produces delectable meals is pit cooking.  It's also a great camp cooking system if you're using a dutch oven or cast iron cookware. Pit cooking calms your meals by heating rocks and coals which are buried in the ground. As the rocks cool , their emitted heat cooks the food. To pit cookfirst dig a hole that is about three times bigger than your own cookware. Line the pit with rocks and build a fire in the middle. Once the fire has burned rapidly for approximately one hourpush the hot coals and rocks into the center. Twist your wrapped meals or covered skillets on top of the stones and coals and place on top. Following a few hours, you will have some tasty camp food to enjoy.
