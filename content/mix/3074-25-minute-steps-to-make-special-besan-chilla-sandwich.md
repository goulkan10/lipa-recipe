Becoming A Healthy Eater

    
Camp cooking can be as elaborate or simple as you want it to be. If you would like to prepare quick and easy but healthy meals as you are camping, camp cooking does not even need to need a flame. But if you're considering fueling your camping trip using a feast, then camp cooking can allow you to make hot, healthy foods that are as good as you can make them at home in your own kitchen.

Camp cooking does not have to be limited to sandwiches and baked potatoes wrapped in aluminum foil.  Just about any cooking procedure you use from the kitchen could be replicated around the campfire. For instance, use a dutch oven or pit cooking to bake your meals. You might also easily bake foods in a pan over a grill, or boil, braise and roast. Which type of camping cookware is best for you? Camp cooking and clean-up may be easy or a hassle, it all starts with great camping gear.

Some pots/pans arrive in sets that partner together or"nest" for storage and also allow you to tuck a spoonful of fuel inside them. This comes in handy when you're seeking to save space whilst camping.

Following are some camping things to take with you if you're considering preparing some meals around the home. These common kitchen items will allow you to duplicate tasty meals as you're out of doors.

• Salt and pepper
• Other of your favourite herbs and spices
• Cooking oil
• Pot holder
• Hand-held can opener
• Aluminum foil

• Cutting knives
• Cutting board
• Mixing bowl


If you have only a couple of campers and are looking for some simple camp cooking, try the easy and fast technique of tin can cooking. All you will need is a clean tin can -- a 1 gallon size can works well. Your source of heat can be a small campfire, or when wood burning is illegal, a little buddy burner will work nicely, which can be located at sporting good stores or online. Put your meal from the tin can and simply warm the contents of your own can over a flame. You will have a hot meal ready in minutes.  This technique works great for soups, beans and poultry.

A more time-consuming pub cooking technique that also produces delectable food is pit cooking. Pit cooking is great for items that can be wrapped in aluminum foil to be cooked.  It's also a excellent camp cooking method if you are using a dutch oven or cast iron cookware. Pit cooking warms your meals by heating rocks and coals which are concealed in the ground. As the stones cool off, their emitted heat cooks the food. To pit cookfirst dig a hole that is roughly three times bigger than your cookware. Line the pit with stones and create a fire in the middle. When the flame has burnt rapidly for about one hour, push the hot coals and stone into the center. Twist your wrapped meals covered skillets on top of the stones and coals and place more on top. Following a few hours, you will have some tasty camp food to relish.
