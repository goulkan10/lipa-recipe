Getting A Healthy Eater

    
Camp cooking can be as elaborate or simple as you would like it to be. If you want to prepare fast and simple but healthy meals when you are swimming, camp cooking doesn't even need to need a fire. But if you are considering fueling your camping excursion with a feast, then camp cooking can enable you to make hot, healthy foods that are as great as you can create them at home in your own kitchen.

Camp cooking does not need to be limited to sandwiches and baked potatoes wrapped in aluminum foil.  Almost any cooking method you use from the kitchen could be replicated around the campfire. For instance, use a dutch oven or pit cooking to bake your meals. You might also easily fry foods in a pan over a grill, or boil, braise and beverage. What sort of camping cookware is ideal for you? Camp cooking and clean-up may be easy or a hassle, it all starts with great camping gear.

Some pots/pans arrive in places that mate jointly or"nest" for storage and also let you tuck a spoonful of fuel inside them. This comes in handy when you're searching to save space while camping.

Following are some camping things to take with you if you are planning on preparing some meals around the campfire. These common kitchen items allow you to replicate yummy meals while you're out of doorways.

• Salt and pepper
• Other of your favorite herbs and spices
• Cooking oil
• Pot holder

• Aluminum foil
• Tongs and spatula
• Cutting knives
• Cutting board
• Mixing bowl
• Paper or plastic silverware, plates and cups

When you have only a couple of campers and are searching for some very simple camp cooking, try out the easy and quick technique of tin can cooking. All you'll need is a fresh tin can -- a 1 gallon size can works nicely. Your source of warmth can be a small campfire, or when wood burning is illegal, a small buddy burner will work nicely, which can be seen at sporting good stores or online. Place your meal from the tin could and simply warm the contents of your own can over a flame. You will have a hot meal ready in seconds.  This technique works great for soups, beans and tuna fish.

A more time-consuming pub cooking technique that also produces tasty food is pit cooking.  It is also a great camp cooking method if you are using a dutch oven or cast iron cookware. Pit cooking warms your meals by heating rocks and coals which are concealed in the ground. As the rocks cool off, their emitted heat cooks the food. To pit cookfirst dig a hole that is approximately three times bigger than your cookware. Line the pit with stones and build a fire in the center. When the fire has burned rapidly for about an hour, push the warm coals and rocks into the middle. Layer your wrapped meals covered skillets in addition to the stones and coals and put on top. Following a number of hours, you'll have some tasty camp food to enjoy.
