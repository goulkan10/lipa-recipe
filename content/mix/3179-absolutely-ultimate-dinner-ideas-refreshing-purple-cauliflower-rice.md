<i>Before you jump to Purple Cauliflower Rice recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about {<strong>Easy Ways to Get Healthy</strong>.</i>
Becoming A Healthy Eater

    
Camp cooking can be as complicated or simple as you want it to be. If you want to prepare fast and simple but nutritious meals as you are camping, camp cooking does not even need to need a flame. However, if you are considering ridding your camping trip using a feast, camp cooking can make it possible for you to make hot, healthy foods that are as good as you can create them at home in your own kitchen.

Camp cooking doesn't have to be limited to sandwiches and baked potatoes wrapped in aluminum foil.  Just about any cooking process you are using from the kitchen could be duplicated around the home. For example, use a toaster or pit cooking to consume your meals. You can also easily bake foods at a bowl over a grill, or boil, braise and roast. What type of camping cookware is ideal for you? Camp cooking and clean-up can be easy or a hassle, but it all starts with great camping gear.

Some pots/pans arrive in sets that mate jointly or"nest" for storage and also allow you to tuck a canister of gas within them. This comes in handy once you're wanting to save room while camping.

Listed below are some camping items to consider with you if you are planning on preparing some meals around the home. These frequent kitchen items will allow you to replicate yummy meals as you are out of doors.


• Other your favourite herbs and spices
• Cooking oil
• Pot holder
• Hand-held can opener
• Aluminum foil

• Cutting knives
• Cutting board
• Mixing bowl
• Paper or plastic silverware, plates and cups

If you have just a couple of campers and are searching for some simple camp cooking, try out the simple and fast technique of tin can cooking. All you'll need is a fresh tin can -- a 1 gallon size can works nicely. Your source of heat may be little campfire, or if wood burning is prohibited, a little buddy burner may work nicely, which may be located at sporting good stores or online. Place your meal from the tin can and simply heat the contents of your can over a flame.  This technique works great for sauces, beans and poultry.

A more time-consuming camp cooking technique which also produces tasty meals is pit cooking. Pit cooking is great for items that could be wrapped in aluminum foil to be cooked.  It is also a excellent camp cooking system if you're using a dutch oven or cast iron cookware. Pit cooking warms your meals by heating rocks and coals which are concealed in the ground. As the stones cool away, their emitted heat cooks the meals. To pit cookfirst dig a hole that is approximately three times bigger than your own cookware. Line the pit with rocks and create a fire in the middle. When the flame has burnt rapidly for approximately an hourpush the warm coals and stone into the center. Layer your wrapped food or covered skillets on top of the stones and coals and place more on top. Following a number of hours, you'll have some tasty camp food to enjoy.

Cauliflower rice is simple to make using a food processor. Remove the florets from a head of cauliflower and pulse in the machine until the florets break down into a grainy texture, this only take a few pulses, and it happens in under a minute. Cauliflower florets are naturally crumbly, so they break down easily. Cut the cauliflower into florets and discard the tough inner core. In a food processor place the florets and process until the cauliflower starts to look like rice-sized pieces.
