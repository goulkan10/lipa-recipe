You're able to spend less time cleaning just as you spent time slaving over a hot cooker. Oh wait! Make that no time slaving over a hot stove. Once clean up is complete you can contact enjoying the sun set, pursuing the lightening bugs with your small ones, or even waiting for the very first superstar.
