Becoming A Healthy Eater

    
Camp cooking can be as elaborate or simple as you want it to be. If you wish to prepare quick and easy but nutritious meals as you're camping, camp cooking doesn't even need to require a flame. But if you are thinking about fueling your camping trip having a feast, then camp cooking can enable you to make warm, healthy foods that are as great as you can create them at home in your kitchen.

Camp cooking does not need to be limited to sandwiches and baked potatoes wrapped in aluminum foil.  Almost any cooking procedure you are using in the kitchen can be duplicated around the home. For example, use a dutch oven or pit cooking to bake your meals. You might also easily fry foods at a pan over a grill, or boil, braise and beverage. What type of camping cookware is ideal for you? Camp cooking and cleanup may be easy or a hassle, and it all starts with great camping gear.

Some pots/pans come in sets that mate jointly or"nest" for storage and even let you tuck a canister of fuel inside them. This comes in handy when you're looking to save space while camping.

Following are some camping items to consider with you if you're considering preparing some meals around the campfire. These frequent kitchen items allow you to replicate yummy meals when you're out of doorways.

• Salt and pepper
• Other your favourite herbs and spices
• Cooking oil
• Pot holder
• Hand-held can opener
• Aluminum foil

• Cutting knives
• Cutting board
• Mixing bowl


In case you have just a few campers and are looking for some easy camp cooking, try the simple and speedy technique of tin could cooking. All you'll need is a clean tin can -- a 1 gallon size may works well. Your source of warmth can be a small campfire, or when wood burning is illegal, a small buddy burner will work nicely, which can be found at sporting good stores or online. Place your meal from the tin could and easily heat the contents of your own can over a flame. You will have a hot meal ready in seconds.  This technique works great for soups, beans and poultry.

A more time-consuming pub cooking technique that also produces tasty meals is pit cooking. Pit cooking is good for items which may be wrapped in aluminum foil to be cooked.  It is also a excellent camp cooking system if you're using a dutch oven or cast iron cookware. Pit cooking calms your food by heating rocks and coals which are buried in the floor. As the rocks cool , their emitted heat cooks the food. To pit cook, first dig a hole that's about three times bigger than your own cookware. Line the pit with rocks and construct a fire in the center. Once the flame has burned rapidly for approximately one hour, push the warm coals and stone into the center. Twist your wrapped food covered skillets in addition to the rocks and coals and place more on top. After a few hours, you will have some tasty camp food to relish.
