There are lots of things that you can do yet, in regards to cooking a nice homemade meal that doesn't need conventional stove top or oven cooking.

So, how can crock pot cooking help beat the heat? Simply put, that the crock pot in and of itself puts off a lot less heat compared to cooking than the oven or stove .

This makes crock pot cooking a win-win scenario since the expenses involved in operating a crock pot are far less than the costs involved in managing a stove or oven generally. Whether gas or electric, your stove and oven tend to be considerable energy hogs. Add to that the fact that you are not raising the warmth in your house by conventional means of cooking and you're using even less electricity.

Another excellent reason to use a crock pot for the summer cooking is the ease of clean up.  Unlike vegetables and pans, many crock pot foods are made in 1 dish. This usually means that there won't be mountains of dishes to be either hand washed or packed into the dishwasher (or if you are like me-both) afterwards. You're able to spend less time cleaning as you spent less time slaving over a hot stove. Oh wait! Make that no time slaving over a hot stove. Once tidy is complete you can contact enjoying the sun set, pursuing the lightening bugs along with your small ones, or waiting for the very first superstar.
