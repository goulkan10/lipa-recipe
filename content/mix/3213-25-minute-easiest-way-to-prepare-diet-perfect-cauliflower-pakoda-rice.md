One other great reason to use a crock pot for the summer cooking is that the ease of clean up.  Unlike pots and pans, most crock pot meals are created in one dish. This usually means that there will not be mountains of meals to be either hand washed or packed to the dishwasher (or if you're like me-both) afterwards. You can spend less time cleaning as you spent less time slaving over a hot stove. Oh wait! Make that time slaving over a hot stove. After clean up is complete you can contact enjoying the sun set, chasing the lightening bugs with your small ones, or even waiting for the first superstar.

While there will be no 1 size fits all very ideal cooking system, crock pot cooking comes very close. When you have a crock pot collecting dust somewhere in the back of your pantry it is time to get it out, dust in the off, and dig up some fantastic summer crock pot cooking recipes.
