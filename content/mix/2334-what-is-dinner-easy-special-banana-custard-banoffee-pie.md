recipeingredient:
- " For the base"
- "300 g milk chocolate digestives"
- "100 g unsalted butter melted"
- " For the caramel"
- "100 g unsalted butter"
- "100 g dark brown soft sugar"
- "1 (397 g) tin sweetened condensed milk"
- " For the banana custard"
- "1 banana"
- "250 ml full fat milk"
- "1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract"
- "2 egg yolks"
- "45 g caster sugar"
- "25 g plain flour"
- "1 teaspoon cornflour"
- " For the topping"
- "1 banana"
- "300 ml whipping cream whipped"
recipeinstructions:
- "Crush your biscuits (you can use ordinary digestives if you prefer) and add the melted butter to them. Combine thoroughly. Spread the mix all over the base of a 23cm deep fluted loose bottom pie/flan tin or similar tin. Press down firmly and into the sides. Put it into the fridge to firm up whilst you prepare your caramel."
- "Put the butter and dark brown sugar into a saucepan and melt over a low heat. Only do this so that the sugar dissolves. Add in the condensed milk. Stirring constantly, let it come to a simmer and keep stirring for 6 to 8 minutes so that it thickens up and goes a rich, dark, golden colour. Remove from the heat and immediately pour into your biscuit base. Smooth it all over the base, trying to keep an even, level surface. Pop back into the fridge to cool."
- "Now onto the banana custard. Mash up your banana and put it to one side. Measure out 200ml of the milk and add the vanilla extract to it. Pop it into the microwave for 1 minute. This should get it hot but not boiling – that’s how you want it. In a bowl whisk the egg yolks and sugar together until they’re pale in colour and fluffy. Add the flour and cornflour to that and whisk again until you get a thick but smooth consistency. Add the remaining 50ml of cold milk and whisk that in."
- "Now add this mixture to the warm milk and put it all in a saucepan, making sure it’s all whisked together first. Put on a low heat and stir constantly for 6 to 8 minutes until it thickens up. Do not let it boil! Remove from the heat, stir in your mashed banana."
- "Remove the tin with the biscuit base and caramel from the fridge and add the banana custard to the top, spreading over the caramel layer evenly (ensure, of course, that the caramel layer has cooled and set first). Pop in the fridge again to cool for about 30 mins to 1 hour."
- "Finally, slice up a banana. Randomly place over the top of the banana custard and then spread your whipped cream over the top of the lot. Decorate the top of the cream in whatever way you like. Some people dust with cocoa powder, some with crushed chocolate (I used a chocolate topping). Enjoy your banana custard banoffee pie – and you will!"

To make pudding, sift flour and sugar into to a large bowl. Combine milk, eggs and butter in a medium jug. To make the base, crush the biscuits to fine crumbs and melt the butter over a low heat. Pour into a bowl and mix to combine. The pair developed the now-famous pie after tweaking a recipe for the US Blum&#39;s coffee toffee pie and introducing banana.
