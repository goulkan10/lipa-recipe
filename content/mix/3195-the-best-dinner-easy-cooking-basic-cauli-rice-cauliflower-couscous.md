recipeingredient:
- " Basic Cauli Rice with Meat"
- "1 large cauliflower head washed and minced"
- "1 red onion chopped"
- "1/4 of a garlic head chopped"
- "1/4 of an inch slice of butter"
- "Pcs meat ex bacon sausage mince"
- "2-3 Tbsp Meat drippings"
- "1 pc fried egg"
- "1 tsp Garnish optional"
- "to taste Salt"
- "to taste Pepper"
- " Flavored Cauli Rice"
- "1 tsp Nasi Goreng paste"
recipeinstructions:
- "Cook your meat first in a pan. I used a salty-garlicky sausage link called longganisa in the Philippines. This sausage gives out a lot of drippings that will definitely make the cauli rice tasty. Another good option is bacon or prosciutto."
- "Romove your meat from pan and ser aside. Lower the heat, sauté the onions then add the garlic."
- "Roughly chop your meat and add to the pan. Sauté with the onions and garlic."
- "How to prep the cauliflower: wash and dry it well using a towel. Cut into florets. Separate the stalks and remove the non-edible green leaves of course. You can use the stalks connected to the flower heads, just make sure to mince well. I used a chopper/mincer machine this time, faster! After mincing, let it air dry or squeeze through with a paper towel. We need to dry it or else it will become mushy after cooking."
- "Add portion by portion to your pan with the garlic-onion-meat. Season with salt and pepper. I added butter when the drippings were absorbed fully, and started looking dry. Keep mixing until everything is cooked."
- "Garnish with a sunny side up or scrambled egg strips. Garnish with parsely or green onions on top. I used bell pepper, it&#39;s what I had in the fridge."
- "Flavored Cauli Rice- I tried a Nasi Goreng paste. Normally it&#39;s used on rice, but it worked well with the cauli rice too. Just add a small amount, mix well."

<i>Before you jump to Basic Cauli Rice / Cauliflower Couscous recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about {<strong>The Simple Ways to Be Healthy</strong>.</i>
Getting A Healthy Eater

    
Camp cooking can be as elaborate or simple as you want it to be. If you want to prepare fast and easy but healthy meals while you're camping, camp cooking doesn't even have to require a fire. However, if you're thinking about ridding your camping excursion with a feast, then camp cooking can allow you to earn warm, healthy foods that are as great as you can make them at home in your own kitchen.

Camp cooking does not need to be limited to sandwiches and baked potatoes wrapped in aluminum foil.  Almost any cooking system you are using from the kitchen can be duplicated around the home. For example, use a dutch oven or pit cooking to consume your food. You could also easily bake foods at a bowl over a grill, or boil, braise and roast. What type of camping cookware is best for you? Camp cooking and clean-up can be easy or a hassle, and it all starts with great camping gear.

Some pots/pans come in places that partner together or"nest" for storage and also allow you to tuck a spoonful of fuel inside them. This really comes in handy when you're searching to save space whilst camping.

Listed below are some camping things to carry with you if you are considering preparing some meals around the home. These common kitchen items will allow you to replicate yummy meals when you're out of doorways.

• Salt and pepper
• Other of your favorite herbs and spices
• Cooking oil
• Pot holder
• Hand-held can opener
• Aluminum foil

• Cutting knives
• Cutting board
• Mixing bowl


When you have only a couple of campers and are looking for some very easy camp cooking, try the easy and quick technique of tin can cooking. All you will need is a fresh tin can -- a 1 gallon size can works well. Your source of warmth may be little campfire, or if wood burning is prohibited, a little buddy burner may work well, which may be found at sporting good stores or online. Place your meal from the tin could and just warm the contents of your own can over a flame. You will have a hot meal ready in minutes.  This technique works great for sauces, beans and poultry.

A more time-consuming camp cooking technique that also produces delectable meals is pit cooking.  It's also a excellent camp cooking system if you are using a dutch oven or cast iron cookware. Pit cooking warms your food by heating rocks and coals that are buried in the ground. As the rocks cool away, their emitted heat cooks the meals. To pit cookfirst dig a hole that is approximately three times bigger than your own cookware. Line the pit with rocks and build a fire in the middle. Once the fire has burnt rapidly for approximately an hour, push the warm coals and rocks into the center. Layer your wrapped food covered skillets on top of the stones and coals and place more on top. After a few hours, you will have some delicious camp food to relish.

Making cauliflower couscous couldn&#39;t be easier. You just grind up fresh cauliflower florets in a food processor until they resemble couscous. Steam the cauliflower in just enough water to coat the bottom of a pan. Then lightly sauté some nuts, fruit, and onions and toss with the &#34;couscous&#34;. You might think that homemade cauliflower rice is difficult or time consuming to make.
