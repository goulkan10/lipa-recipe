It is possible to spend less time cleaning just as you spent less time slaving over a hot cooker. Oh wait! Ensure time slaving over a hot stove. Once clean up is complete you can contact enjoying the sunshine set, chasing the lightening bugs along with your little ones, or even waiting for your first celebrity.

While there'll be no one size fits all ideal cooking system, crock pot cooking comes really near. In case you have a crock pot collecting dust somewhere at the back of your pantry it's time to get out it, dust if off, and dig up some great summertime crock pot cooking recipes.
