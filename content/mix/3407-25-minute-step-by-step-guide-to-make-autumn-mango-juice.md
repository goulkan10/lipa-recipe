Second, many great crock pot recipes include the vegetables that guarantee we are getting the nutrients we need. So often, when planning a meal in the last minute, vegetables and other side dishes have been made in favour of expedience. Crock pot cooking in many cases is really a meal in one dish.

One other excellent reason to use a crock pot for the summer cooking is that the ease of clean up.  Unlike pans and pans, many crock pot meals are made in one dish. This usually means that there will not be mountains of dishes to be hand washed or loaded to the dishwasher (or in case you are like me-both) afterwards. It is possible to spend less time cleaning just as you spent time slaving over a hot cooker. Oh wait! Ensure time slaving over a hot stove.

Plain water adds no nutrition or flavor to the juice. So I use oranges or tender coconut water which enhances the nutrition &amp; taste as well. Tender coconut water is nature&#39;s best thirst quenching and rehydrating drink available to us. Mango juice is made by pressing or blending out the juice from the soft, orange pulp of the mango to deliver significant amounts of vitamin C, vitamin A, potassium, iron, various carotenoids, and potent organic acids in every glass of juice. So, health benefits of mango juice are tremendous and amazing.
