However, if you're thinking about ridding your camping excursion using a feast, camp cooking can make it possible for you to make warm, healthy foods which are as good as you can make them at home in your own kitchen.

Camp cooking does not need to be limited to sandwiches and baked potatoes wrapped in aluminum foil.  Just about any cooking procedure you use from the kitchen could be replicated around the campfire. For instance, use a dutch oven or pit cooking to bake your meals. You could also easily bake foods in a pan over a grill, or boil, braise and roast. What type of camping cookware is best for you?
