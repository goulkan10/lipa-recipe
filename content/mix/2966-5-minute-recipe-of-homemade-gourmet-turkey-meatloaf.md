Not a turkey loaf, not a lentil loaf, a meatloaf. Loaf.&#34; But a meatloaf like this one is a thing of beauty. There is a strong nostalgia factor when. Roast it whole, with native herbs and spices like Jock Zonfrillo does, perhaps, or head for Heston Blumenthal&#39;s tried-and-true recipe for roast turkey and gravy; or for ease, just stuff and roast turkey legs. Grease a loaf tin and line with baking paper, ensuring there is enough to run off the sides.
