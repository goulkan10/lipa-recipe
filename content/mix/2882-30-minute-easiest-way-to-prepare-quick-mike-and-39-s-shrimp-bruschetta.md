- "For a Warmed Bruschetta:                                Add 2 tbs olive oil to your pan, heat it up and add your onions, garlic, sun dried tomatoes and shrimp.

Becoming A Healthy Eater

    
Camp cooking can be as complicated or simple as you would like it to be. If you would like to prepare fast and easy but healthy meals while you are camping, camp cooking does not even need to require a fire. However, if you are thinking about ridding your camping trip with a feast, then camp cooking can make it possible for you to earn warm, healthy foods that are as good as you can make them at home in your own kitchen.

Camp cooking doesn't need to be limited to sandwiches and baked potatoes wrapped in aluminum foil.  Just about any cooking method you are using in the kitchen can be replicated around the home. For instance, use a dutch oven or pit cooking to bake your meals. You might also easily bake foods in a bowl over a grill, or boil, braise and beverage. What sort of camping cookware is ideal for you? Camp cooking and cleanup may be easy or a hassle, but it all starts with great camping gear.

Some pots/pans come in sets that partner jointly or"nest" for storage and even allow you to tuck a canister of gas within them. This comes in handy when you're wanting to save room while camping.

Following are some camping things to carry with you if you are thinking about preparing some meals around the home. These common kitchen items allow you to replicate yummy meals when you're out of doors.

• Salt and pepper
• Other of your favourite herbs and spices
• Cooking oil
• Pot holder
• Hand-held can opener
• Aluminum foil

• Cutting knives
• Cutting board
• Mixing bowl


When you have just a couple of campers and are searching for some easy camp cooking, try the easy and speedy technique of tin could cooking. All you'll need is a clean tin can -- a 1 gallon size can works nicely. Your source of heat may be little campfire, or if wood burning is illegal, a small buddy burner may work well, which may be located at sporting good stores or online. Place your meal in the tin can and simply warm the contents of your own can over a fire.  This technique works great for sauces, beans and poultry.

A more time-consuming camp cooking technique which also produces tasty food is pit cooking.  It's also a great camp cooking method if you are using a dutch oven or cast iron cookware. Pit cooking warms your meals by heating stones and coals that are concealed in the ground. As the stones cool off, their emitted heat cooks the meals. To pit cook, first dig a hole that is about three times bigger than your cookware. Line the pit with rocks and create a fire in the center. When the flame has burnt rapidly for about an hour, push the hot coals and rocks into the center. Layer your wrapped food covered skillets in addition to the stones and coals and put on top. Following a number of hours, you'll have some delicious camp food to relish.
