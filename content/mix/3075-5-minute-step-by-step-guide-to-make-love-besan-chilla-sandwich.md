Getting A Healthy Eater

    
Camp cooking can be as complicated or simple as you would like it to be. If you would like to prepare quick and easy but healthy meals while you are camping, camp cooking does not even need to require a fire. However, if you are considering fueling your camping excursion having a feast, then camp cooking can make it possible for you to earn warm, healthy foods that are as good as you can make them at home in your own kitchen.

 Almost any cooking method you are using from the kitchen can be duplicated around the campfire. For instance, use a toaster or pit cooking to bake your meals. You can also easily fry foods in a pan over a grill, or boil, braise and beverage. Which type of camping cookware is ideal for you? Camp cooking and cleanup may be easy or a hassle, it all starts with great camping equipment.

Some pots/pans come in places that mate together or"nest" for storage and even allow you to tuck a canister of fuel inside them. This really comes in handy once you're looking to save room while camping.

Following are some camping items to carry with you if you're considering preparing some meals around the home. These frequent kitchen items allow you to duplicate tasty meals while you are out of doors.

• Salt and pepper
• Other of your favorite herbs and spices
• Cooking oil
• Pot holder
• Hand-held can opener
• Aluminum foil

• Cutting knives
• Cutting board
• Mixing bowl


If you have just a couple campers and are looking for some very simple camp cooking, try the easy and speedy technique of tin may cooking. All you'll need is a fresh tin can -- a 1 gallon size can works well. Your source of warmth may be little campfire, or if wood burning is prohibited, a little buddy burner may work nicely, which may be seen at sporting good stores or online. Place your meal from the tin could and easily heat the contents of your can over a fire. You will have a hot meal ready in seconds.  This technique works great for sauces, beans and poultry.

A more time-consuming pub cooking technique that also produces tasty food is pit cooking.  It's also a great camp cooking method if you're using a dutch oven or cast iron cookware. Pit cooking calms your food by heating rocks and coals which are concealed in the ground. As the stones cool away, their emitted heat cooks the meals. To pit cook, first dig a hole that's about three times bigger than your own cookware. Line the pit with stones and build a fire in the center. Once the fire has burned rapidly for approximately one hourpush the hot coals and rocks into the middle. Twist your wrapped food or covered skillets on top of the stones and coals and put more on top. Following a number of hours, you will have some tasty camp food to relish.
