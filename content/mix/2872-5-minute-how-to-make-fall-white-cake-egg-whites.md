<i>Before you jump to White Cake (egg whites) recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about {<strong>The Simple Ways to Be Healthy</strong>.</i>
Becoming A Healthy Eater

    
Camp cooking can be as elaborate or simple as you want it to be. If you wish to prepare quick and easy but nutritious meals as you are swimming, camp cooking doesn't even need to need a flame. But if you're interested in fueling your camping trip using a feast, camp cooking can enable you to earn warm, healthy foods that are as good as you can create them at home in your kitchen.

Camp cooking does not have to be limited to sandwiches and baked potatoes wrapped in aluminum foil.  Just about any cooking system you use in the kitchen could be replicated around the campfire. For instance, use a dutch oven or pit cooking to bake your meals. You could also easily bake foods in a bowl over a grill, or boil, braise and beverage. Which sort of camping cookware is ideal for you? Camp cooking and cleanup may be easy or a hassle, it all starts with great camping equipment.

Some pots/pans come in sets that mate together or"nest" for storage and even let you tuck a canister of fuel inside them. This really comes in handy when you're trying to save space whilst camping.

Listed below are some camping items to take with you if you are considering preparing some meals around the campfire. These common kitchen items will allow you to duplicate tasty meals while you're out of doorways.

• Salt and pepper
• Other of your favorite herbs and spices
• Cooking oil
• Pot holder

• Aluminum foil
• Tongs and spatula
• Cutting knives
• Cutting board
• Mixing bowl


When you have only a couple of campers and are looking for some simple camp cooking, try out the easy and speedy technique of tin could cooking. All you'll need is a fresh tin can -- a one gallon size may works nicely. Your source of warmth may be small campfire, or when wood burning is prohibited, a small buddy burner may work well, which can be found at sporting good stores or online. Place your meal in the tin could and just warm the contents of your can over a flame. You will have a hot meal ready in seconds.  This technique works great for soups, beans and poultry.

A more time-consuming camp cooking technique which also produces yummy meals is pit cooking. Pit cooking is excellent for items that may be wrapped in aluminum foil to be cooked.  It's also a wonderful camp cooking system if you are using a dutch oven or cast iron cookware. Pit cooking calms your food by heating stones and coals that are buried in the ground. As the stones cool away, their emitted heat cooks the food. To pit cook, first dig a hole that's about three times bigger than your own cookware. Line the pit with stones and construct a fire in the middle. When the flame has burned rapidly for about one hour, push the warm coals and stone into the middle. Twist your wrapped food covered skillets in addition to the rocks and coals and place on top. After a number of hours, you will have some delicious camp food to relish.
