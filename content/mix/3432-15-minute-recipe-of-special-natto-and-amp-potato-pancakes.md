But if you're thinking about fueling your camping trip with a feast, camp cooking can make it possible for you to earn hot, healthy foods which are as great as you can make them at home in your kitchen.

Camp cooking does not need to be limited to sandwiches and baked potatoes wrapped in aluminum foil.  Almost any cooking system you are using in the kitchen can be duplicated around the home. For instance, use a dutch oven or pit cooking to bake your food. You may also easily bake foods in a pan over a grill, or boil, braise and roast. What kind of camping cookware is best for you? Camp cooking and cleanup can be easy or a hassle, and it all starts with great camping equipment.

Some pots/pans come in places that mate collectively or"nest" for storage and even let you tuck a canister of gas within them. This really comes in handy when you're looking to save space while camping.

All you will need is a fresh tin can -- a one gallon size can works nicely. Your source of warmth may be little campfire, or if wood burning is prohibited, a little buddy burner will work nicely, which can be located at sporting good stores or online.

As the rocks cool away, their emitted heat cooks the food. To pit cookfirst dig a hole that is about three times bigger than your cookware. Line the pit with rocks and create a fire in the center. Once the fire has burnt rapidly for about one hourpush the warm coals and stone into the center. Twist your wrapped food covered skillets on top of the stones and coals and place more on top. After a couple of hours, you will have some tasty camp food to relish.
