This means that there is not going to be mountains of meals to be hand cleaned or packed into the dishwasher (or in case you are like me-both) afterwards. It's possible to spend less time cleaning as you spent time slaving over a hot cooker. Oh wait! Make that time slaving over a hot cooker. After clean up is complete you can get back to enjoying the sunshine set, chasing the lightening bugs with your little ones, or even waiting for your very first star.
