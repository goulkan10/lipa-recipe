<i>Before you jump to Garlic Clam Pasta w/ Rib-eye &amp; Scallops recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about {<strong>The Basics of Being Healthy</strong>.</i>
Getting A Healthy Eater

    
Camp cooking can be as elaborate or simple as you would like it to be. If you want to prepare quick and easy but nutritious meals as you're camping, camp cooking does not even have to need a fire. But if you're considering fueling your camping trip using a feast, then camp cooking can allow you to earn warm, healthy foods which are as good as you can create them at home in your own kitchen.

 Almost any cooking method you are using in the kitchen can be replicated around the home. For instance, use a toaster or pit cooking to bake your meals. You can also easily bake foods at a bowl over a grill, or boil, braise and roast. What type of camping cookware is ideal for you? Camp cooking and cleanup may be easy or a hassle, it all starts with great camping equipment.

Some pots/pans arrive in places that partner together or"nest" for storage and even let you tuck a canister of gas within them. This really comes in handy once you're wanting to save room while camping.

Following are some camping items to consider with you if you're thinking about preparing some meals around the home. These common kitchen items allow you to replicate yummy meals when you are out of doors.

• Salt and pepper
• Other your favourite herbs and spices
• Cooking oil
• Pot holder

• Aluminum foil
• Tongs and spatula
• Cutting knives
• Cutting board
• Mixing bowl


In case you have just a few campers and are looking for some very easy camp cooking, try out the easy and quick technique of tin can cooking. All you will need is a fresh tin can -- a 1 gallon size can works well. Your source of heat may be small campfire, or if wood burning is illegal, a small buddy burner may work well, which can be found at sporting good stores or online. Place your meal from the tin could and simply heat the contents of your can over a fire. You'll have a hot meal ready in seconds.  This technique works great for sauces, beans and poultry.

A more time-consuming camp cooking technique that also produces yummy food is pit cooking. Pit cooking is excellent for items that may be wrapped in aluminum foil to be cooked.  It is also a great camp cooking system if you're using a dutch oven or cast iron cookware. Pit cooking calms your meals by heating stones and coals which are concealed in the ground. As the rocks cool off, their emitted heat cooks the meals. To pit cookfirst dig a hole that's approximately three times larger than your own cookware. Line the pit with rocks and build a fire in the middle. Once the fire has burned rapidly for about one hour, push the hot coals and stone into the middle. Layer your wrapped meals covered skillets on top of the rocks and coals and put more on top. After a few hours, you will have some delicious camp food to relish.
