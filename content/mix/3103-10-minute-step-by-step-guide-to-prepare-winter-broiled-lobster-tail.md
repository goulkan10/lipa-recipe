Becoming A Healthy Eater

    
Camp cooking can be as elaborate or simple as you want it to be. If you want to prepare quick and easy but healthy meals while you're camping, camp cooking does not even have to need a flame. But if you're considering ridding your camping trip using a feast, then camp cooking can allow you to earn hot, healthy foods that are as good as you can create them at home in your own kitchen.

Camp cooking doesn't need to be limited to sandwiches and baked potatoes wrapped in aluminum foil.  Almost any cooking method you are using from the kitchen can be replicated around the campfire. For example, use a toaster or pit cooking to bake your meals. You can also easily fry foods at a pan over a grill, or boil, braise and roast. Which sort of camping cookware is ideal for you? Camp cooking and clean-up may be easy or a hassle, but it all starts with great camping gear.

Some pots/pans arrive in places that partner jointly or"nest" for storage and even allow you to tuck a spoonful of gas within them. This also comes in handy when you're looking to save room while camping.

Following are some camping things to carry with you if you're considering preparing some meals around the home. These common kitchen items will allow you to duplicate tasty meals as you are out of doors.

• Salt and pepper
• Other of your favorite herbs and spices
• Cooking oil
• Pot holder

• Aluminum foil
• Tongs and spatula
• Cutting knives
• Cutting board
• Mixing bowl
• Paper or plastic silverware, plates and cups

If you have only a couple campers and are looking for some easy camp cooking, try out the easy and speedy technique of tin may cooking. All you'll need is a clean tin can -- a one gallon size can works nicely. Your source of heat may be small campfire, or if wood burning is illegal, a little buddy burner may work well, which can be found at sporting good stores or online. Put your meal from the tin could and just warm the contents of your can over a flame.  This technique works great for soups, beans and tuna fish.

A more time-consuming pub cooking technique that also produces yummy meals is pit cooking. Pit cooking is fantastic for items that can be wrapped in aluminum foil to be cooked.  It's also a wonderful camp cooking system if you're using a dutch oven or cast iron cookware. Pit cooking warms your food by heating stones and coals that are concealed in the floor. As the rocks cool , their emitted heat cooks the meals. To pit cookfirst dig a hole that is approximately three times larger than your own cookware. Line the pit with rocks and build a fire in the middle. When the fire has burnt rapidly for about an hourpush the hot coals and stone into the middle. Twist your wrapped food or covered skillets in addition to the stones and coals and place more on top. Following a number of hours, you will have some delicious camp food to relish.
