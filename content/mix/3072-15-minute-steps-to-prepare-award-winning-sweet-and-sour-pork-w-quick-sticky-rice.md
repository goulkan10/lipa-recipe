Once you&#39;ve made this version, I promise you&#39;ll never go back to a mediocre Chinese restaurant for sweet and sour pork again. Sweet and Sour Pork is an iconic Chinese recipe and classic Cantonese dish. Called &#34;咕嚕肉&#34; or &#34; goo lou yok &#34; in Cantonese dialect, this recipe is very pleasing to the palate because of the flavorsome sweet and sour sauce—the sweetness from sugar plus the tangy ketchup and sharp rice vinegar—with the crispy fried pork pieces. Blend cornstarch and soy sauce in small bowl; stir in pork until well coated. In a separate bowl, mix all the coating ingredients.
