Getting A Healthy Eater

    
Camp cooking can be as elaborate or simple as you want it to be. If you wish to prepare fast and simple but nutritious meals as you're camping, camp cooking does not even need to need a flame. But if you're interested in ridding your camping trip having a feast, then camp cooking can enable you to make warm, healthy foods that are as good as you can make them at home in your own kitchen.

 Almost any cooking method you use from the kitchen can be duplicated around the home. For example, use a toaster or pit cooking to consume your meals. You can also easily bake foods in a bowl over a grill, or boil, braise and beverage. What sort of camping cookware is best for you? Camp cooking and cleanup can be easy or a hassle, but it all starts with great camping gear.

Some pots/pans come in places that mate together or"nest" for storage and even allow you to tuck a canister of gas within them. This really comes in handy once you're looking to save space while camping.

Following are some camping things to take with you if you're planning on preparing some meals around the home. These frequent kitchen items will allow you to replicate yummy meals as you are out of doors.


• Other of your favorite herbs and spices
• Cooking oil
• Pot holder
• Hand-held can opener
• Aluminum foil
• Tongs and spatula
• Cutting knives
• Cutting board
• Mixing bowl
• Paper or plastic silverware, plates and cups

If you have just a few campers and are looking for some very simple camp cooking, try the simple and speedy technique of tin may cooking. All you'll need is a fresh tin can -- a 1 gallon size can works nicely. Your source of heat can be a small campfire, or when wood burning is prohibited, a little buddy burner may work well, which may be found at sporting good stores or online. Place your meal from the tin can and easily warm the contents of your own can over a fire.  This technique works great for soups, beans and poultry.

A more time-consuming pub cooking technique that also produces yummy food is pit cooking.  It's also a excellent camp cooking system if you're using a dutch oven or cast iron cookware. Pit cooking warms your meals by heating stones and coals which are buried in the ground. As the rocks cool away, their emitted heat cooks the food. To pit cookfirst dig a hole that is approximately three times larger than your own cookware. Line the pit with rocks and create a fire in the center. When the fire has burned rapidly for approximately an hourpush the hot coals and rocks into the middle. Twist your wrapped food covered skillets on top of the stones and coals and place on top. Following a few hours, you will have some delicious camp food to relish.

Besan ka chilla is prepared with gram flour and is also known as vegetarian omelet. It can be prepared in a jiffy with very few ingredients. The only thing about this dosa is, it should be eaten hot as it does not taste good when cold. I love dosas especially instant dosa as it comes handy when we do not have. Methi Cheela is delicious savory Indian pancake made from Fenugreek Leaves (Methi) mixed with a mildly spiced Gran Flour (Besan) batter.
