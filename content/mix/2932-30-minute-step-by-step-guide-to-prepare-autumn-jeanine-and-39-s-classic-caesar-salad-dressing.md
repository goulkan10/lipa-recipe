- " what you will need"
- "1-2 large eggs room temperature"

recipeinstructions:
- "Place room tempurature egg and oil in a cup. (If the egg is not room tempurature this will not work!)"
- "Ensuring there are no air bubbles under the blade, hold bamix (with whipping blade) at the bottom of the cup. Begin to blend holding it at the bottom for about 10 seconds, and as you see it begin to thicken and turn white, slowly raise the bamix to the top. You should have a mayo consistency."

There are a number of things that you can do yet, when it comes to cooking a wonderful home made meal which does not require traditional stove top or oven cooking. Learn to use some of the lower heat producing equipment in your kitchen, such as the crock pot, to be able to truly conquer the summer heat and keep your cool while preparing a great hot meal for friends and family.

So, how does crock pot cooking really help beat the heat? In other words, that the crock pot in and of itself puts off far less heat compared to cooking than an oven or stove . Here is the very first and maybe the best reason to use the crock pot in your summer meal planning. You should also consider that by not heating your house by utilizing your stove or oven you are also avoiding your air conditioning (or alternative heating systems ) from working overtime to be able to compensate for the extra heat which other cooking systems introduce.

This leaves crock pot cooking a win-win situation since the costs involved with operating a crock marijuana are far less than the expenses related to operating a cooker or stove in general.

This usually means that there isn't going to be mountains of dishes to be either hand washed or loaded to the dishwasher (or in case you're like me-both) later. It's possible to spend less time cleaning only as you spent less time slaving over a hot cooker. Oh wait! Make that no time slaving over a hot stove.
