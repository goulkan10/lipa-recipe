Becoming A Healthy Eater

    
Camp cooking can be as elaborate or simple as you want it to be. If you wish to prepare fast and easy but nutritious meals while you're camping, camp cooking doesn't even have to need a fire. However, if you are considering ridding your camping trip with a feast, then camp cooking can allow you to make hot, healthy foods which are as great as you can make them at home in your own kitchen.

 Almost any cooking method you are using from the kitchen could be duplicated around the campfire. For example, use a dutch oven or pit cooking to bake your meals. You might also easily bake foods at a bowl over a grill, or boil, braise and beverage. Which kind of camping cookware is ideal for you? Camp cooking and cleanup can be easy or a hassle, it all starts with great camping gear.

Some pots/pans arrive in places that mate together or"nest" for storage and even let you tuck a canister of fuel inside them. This really comes in handy once you're searching to save space whilst camping.

Following are some camping items to consider with you if you're planning on preparing some meals around the campfire. These common kitchen items allow you to replicate yummy meals when you're out of doorways.

• Salt and pepper
• Other your favorite herbs and spices
• Cooking oil
• Pot holder
• Hand-held can opener
• Aluminum foil
• Tongs and spatula
• Cutting knives
• Cutting board
• Mixing bowl


If you have only a few campers and are looking for some simple camp cooking, try the simple and speedy technique of tin may cooking. All you will need is a clean tin can -- a one gallon size may works nicely. Your source of heat may be small campfire, or if wood burning is illegal, a small buddy burner will work well, which may be located at sporting good stores or online. Place your meal from the tin can and just heat the contents of your can over a flame.  This technique works great for soups, beans and poultry.

A more time-consuming camp cooking technique that also produces delectable meals is pit cooking.  It's also a great camp cooking method if you're using a dutch oven or cast iron cookware. Pit cooking calms your meals by heating stones and coals that are buried in the ground. As the rocks cool off, their emitted heat cooks the food. To pit cook, first dig a hole that's approximately three times larger than your own cookware. Line the pit with rocks and construct a fire in the center. Once the flame has burned rapidly for approximately an hourpush the hot coals and stones into the center. Twist your wrapped meals or covered skillets in addition to the rocks and coals and place on top. After a number of hours, you will have some delicious camp food to enjoy.
