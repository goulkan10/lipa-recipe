It tastes and looks close to the real thing with a fraction of carbohydrates. I recently made cauliflower rice and it was.disappointing. I know it&#39;s not going to taste the same as rice I like to make fresh cauliflower rice by grating a head of cauliflower using the biggest shred on a box grater. Literally just look up a recipe for fried rice and just sub out the rice for cauliflower rice. This Low Carb, Grain Free Fried Rice is so legit in taste and texture!
