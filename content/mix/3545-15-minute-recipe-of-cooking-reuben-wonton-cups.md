Getting A Healthy Eater

    
Camp cooking can be as elaborate or simple as you want it to be. If you want to prepare quick and easy but healthy meals when you are camping, camp cooking doesn't even have to need a fire. However, if you are thinking about ridding your camping excursion having a feast, then camp cooking can make it possible for you to make hot, healthy foods which are as good as you can make them at home in your kitchen.

 Almost any cooking process you are using from the kitchen could be duplicated around the campfire. For example, use a dutch oven or pit cooking to bake your food. You can also easily fry foods at a pan over a grill, or boil, braise and roast. What kind of camping cookware is best for you? Camp cooking and clean-up can be easy or a hassle, it all starts with great camping gear.

Some pots/pans come in places that mate jointly or"nest" for storage and even let you tuck a canister of gas within them. This also comes in handy when you're looking to save room whilst camping.

Listed below are some camping items to consider with you if you're planning on preparing some meals around the home. These common kitchen items allow you to duplicate tasty meals when you are out of doorways.


• Other of your favourite herbs and spices
• Cooking oil
• Pot holder
• Hand-held can opener
• Aluminum foil

• Cutting knives
• Cutting board
• Mixing bowl
• Paper or plastic silverware, plates and cups

In case you have only a few campers and are looking for some simple camp cooking, try the simple and fast technique of tin can cooking. All you'll need is a fresh tin can -- a one gallon size can works well. Your source of warmth may be small campfire, or when wood burning is illegal, a small buddy burner may work well, which may be seen at sporting good stores or online. Put your meal in the tin can and simply heat the contents of your can over a flame. You will have a hot meal ready in seconds.  This technique works great for soups, beans and tuna fish.

A more time-consuming camp cooking technique which also produces yummy food is pit cooking.  It is also a wonderful camp cooking system if you're using a dutch oven or cast iron cookware. Pit cooking warms your meals by heating stones and coals that are concealed in the floor. As the stones cool , their emitted heat cooks the food. To pit cookfirst dig a hole that is approximately three times larger than your cookware. Line the pit with rocks and build a fire in the center. Once the flame has burned rapidly for about an hourpush the warm coals and rocks into the center. Layer your wrapped meals covered skillets on top of the rocks and coals and place on top. After a couple of hours, you'll have some delicious camp food to relish.
