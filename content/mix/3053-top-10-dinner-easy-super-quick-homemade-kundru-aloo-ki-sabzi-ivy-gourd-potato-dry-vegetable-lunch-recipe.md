This usually means that there isn't going to be mountains of dishes to be hand washed or loaded into the dishwasher (or in case you are like me-both) later. You can spend less time cleaning as you spent less time slaving over a hot cooker. Oh wait! Ensure no time slaving over a hot stove. Once clean up is complete you can get back to enjoying the sunshine set, chasing the lightening bugs with your little ones, or even waiting for your very first celebrity.

While there will never be a one size fits all best cooking procedure, crock pot cooking comes very close. If you have a crock pot gathering dust somewhere in the rear of your pantry it is time to get it out, dust off, and dig some excellent summer crock pot cooking recipes.
