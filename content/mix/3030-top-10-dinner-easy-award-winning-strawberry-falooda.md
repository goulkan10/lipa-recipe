Getting A Healthy Eater

    
Camp cooking can be as elaborate or simple as you want it to be. If you would like to prepare fast and easy but nutritious meals while you are camping, camp cooking does not even have to require a fire. But if you are thinking about fueling your camping excursion with a feast, camp cooking can allow you to make hot, healthy foods that are as good as you can create them at home in your own kitchen.

Camp cooking doesn't need to be limited to sandwiches and baked potatoes wrapped in aluminum foil.  Just about any cooking system you are using from the kitchen can be replicated around the home. For example, use a toaster or pit cooking to consume your food. You might also easily bake foods in a bowl over a grill, or boil, braise and roast. Which sort of camping cookware is best for you? Camp cooking and clean-up may be easy or a hassle, and it all starts with great camping equipment.

Some pots/pans arrive in sets that mate together or"nest" for storage and even allow you to tuck a spoonful of fuel inside them. This also comes in handy once you're looking to save room while camping.

Following are some camping things to consider with you if you are considering preparing some meals around the campfire. These frequent kitchen items will allow you to replicate yummy meals as you are out of doorways.


• Other of your favorite herbs and spices
• Cooking oil
• Pot holder
• Hand-held can opener
• Aluminum foil
• Tongs and spatula
• Cutting knives
• Cutting board
• Mixing bowl


If you have just a few campers and are looking for some easy camp cooking, try out the easy and fast technique of tin may cooking. All you'll need is a clean tin can -- a 1 gallon size can works nicely. Your source of heat may be small campfire, or when wood burning is illegal, a little buddy burner will work well, which can be found at sporting good stores or online. Place your meal in the tin could and simply warm the contents of your own can over a fire. You'll have a hot meal ready in seconds.  This technique works great for sauces, beans and poultry.

A more time-consuming camp cooking technique which also produces tasty meals is pit cooking. Pit cooking is excellent for items which may be wrapped in aluminum foil to be cooked.  It is also a great camp cooking method if you're using a dutch oven or cast iron cookware. Pit cooking warms your food by heating stones and coals that are buried in the ground. As the stones cool , their emitted heat cooks the food. To pit cookfirst dig a hole that is about three times bigger than your cookware. Line the pit with stones and build a fire in the middle. When the flame has burned rapidly for about one hourpush the hot coals and rocks into the middle. Twist your wrapped food or covered skillets in addition to the rocks and coals and place more on top. After a few hours, you will have some tasty camp food to enjoy.
