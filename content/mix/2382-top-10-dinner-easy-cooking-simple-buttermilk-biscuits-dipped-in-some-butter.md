<i>Before you jump to Simple Buttermilk Biscuits Dipped in Some Butter recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about {<strong>The Basics of Being Healthy</strong>.</i>
Becoming A Healthy Eater

Whether your traveling on the Move or round the
House, you don't have to provide up healthy eating
Simply because you're on the run. The Truth Is,
Healthy eating is even more significant when your



Worry better. As you hustle about, a healthy meal
Is probably the very last thing you consider. The
Following ideas may help you eat if your on the move.

Restaurants
With tempting selections, large pieces, and a festive
Air, it's easy to bypass healthy eating. It's
Okay to splurge every now and then, although you'll
Pack a great deal of weight if you make it a habit.
When you eat out at restaurants, always be smart
about it.

Airports
An airport may be a very stressful area, although
You shouldn't squander your diet because of it. Eat
Since you're hungry, not because of stress,
Boredom, or to kill time.

In your Vehicle 

So that when you get hungry - you've got them.

At home
Evenings and mornings are busy times in many houses.
Making the time to eat could be difficult, though you
Shouldn't run out the door without eating breakfast
first. Cereal with milk, a banana, muffin, or even
That a bagel is a terrific way to begin the day.

Anytime you are on the go, always Ensure That you
Make the ideal food choices. You can take healthy
Food with you in the event that you need to, so you have it
When you want it. Eating healthy on the move is easy
To do, as soon as you know how. Never sacrifice healthy
Food for junk, since your own system will regret it afterwards.


<i>We hope you got benefit from reading it, now let's go back to simple buttermilk biscuits dipped in some butter recipe. To cook simple buttermilk biscuits dipped in some butter you need <strong>6</strong> ingredients and <strong>7</strong> steps. Here is how you achieve it.

##### The ingredients needed to prepare Simple Buttermilk Biscuits Dipped in Some Butter:

1. You need 1/2 cup melted butter
1. Use 2 1/2 cups flour
1. Prepare 1 1/2 tbs sugar
1. You need 1 1/2 tbs baking powder
1. Prepare 1 1/2 tsp salt
1. Prepare 1 3/4 cups buttermilk


##### Steps to make Simple Buttermilk Biscuits Dipped in Some Butter:

1. Heat oven to 450 degrees.
1. Melt butter and pour melted butter into baking dish.
1. Combine the flour, sugar, baking powder and salt.
1. Mix in buttermilk. Batter will be sticky. That&#39;s what you want. If it&#39;s dry, add a bit more buttermilk so batter is sticky, but not too sticky.
1. Pour batter on top of butter inside baking dish. I used a knife to cut some squares. It&#39;s ok if the butter flows to top of batter.
1. Bake 20-25 minutes or until brown on top.
1. Enjoy with some whipped butter, preserves or whatever you like to eat biscuits with.


Add in chopped butter and mix with hands or a pastry cutter until it becomes a loose crumble. Add buttermilk and mix until it becomes a sticky ball. Press biscuit dough into baking dish, right on top of the melted butter. It is easiest to spread it out with your hands. (it is okay if some of the butter runs over the top of the dough) Take a sharp knife and cut the biscuit dough into nine squares before baking. I&#39;ll scale down some of my favorite recipes like when I&#39;m craving biscuits, but don&#39;t want to have to finish an entire tray of them.
