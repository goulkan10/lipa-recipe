This usually means that there won't be mountains of dishes to be either hand washed or packed to the dishwasher (or in case you are like me-both) afterwards. You're able to spend less time cleaning just as you spent time slaving over a hot stove. Oh wait! Ensure time slaving over a hot stove. Once clean up is complete you can get back to enjoying the sun set, pursuing the lightening bugs with your little ones, or even waiting for your very first star.
