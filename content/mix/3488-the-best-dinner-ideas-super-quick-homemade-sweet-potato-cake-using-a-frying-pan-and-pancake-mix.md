<i>Before you jump to Sweet Potato Cake using a Frying Pan and Pancake Mix recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about {<strong>Easy Ways to Get Healthy</strong>.</i>
Becoming A Healthy Eater

    
Camp cooking can be as complicated or simple as you want it to be. If you wish to prepare quick and easy but healthy meals as you are camping, camp cooking does not even need to require a flame. However, if you are considering ridding your camping excursion using a feast, camp cooking can allow you to earn hot, healthy foods which are as good as you can make them at home in your kitchen.

 Just about any cooking system you use from the kitchen could be duplicated around the campfire. For instance, use a toaster or pit cooking to bake your meals. You might also easily fry foods in a pan over a grill, or boil, braise and beverage. What type of camping cookware is best for you? Camp cooking and clean-up may be easy or a hassle, and it all starts with great camping equipment.

Some pots/pans come in sets that partner together or"nest" for storage and also let you tuck a canister of fuel inside them. This comes in handy once you're trying to save room while camping.

Following are some camping items to consider with you if you are considering preparing some meals around the campfire. These frequent kitchen items will allow you to duplicate tasty meals when you're out of doors.


• Other your favourite herbs and spices
• Cooking oil
• Pot holder

• Aluminum foil

• Cutting knives
• Cutting board
• Mixing bowl
• Paper or plastic silverware, plates and cups

If you have just a couple campers and are looking for some simple camp cooking, try out the simple and quick technique of tin may cooking. All you will need is a clean tin can -- a 1 gallon size can works nicely. Your source of heat may be small campfire, or when wood burning is illegal, a small buddy burner may work nicely, which can be located at sporting good stores or online. Place your meal in the tin can and simply heat the contents of your own can over a fire. You will have a hot meal ready in seconds.  This technique works great for soups, beans and tuna fish.

A more time-consuming camp cooking technique which also produces tasty meals is pit cooking. Pit cooking is fantastic for items which could be wrapped in aluminum foil to be cooked.  It is also a excellent camp cooking method if you're using a dutch oven or cast iron cookware. Pit cooking warms your meals by heating stones and coals which are concealed in the ground. As the rocks cool , their emitted heat cooks the meals. To pit cook, first dig a hole that's roughly three times larger than your own cookware. Line the pit with rocks and build a fire in the center. When the flame has burned rapidly for about one hour, push the warm coals and stone into the center. Twist your wrapped meals or covered skillets on top of the stones and coals and put more on top. Following a number of hours, you will have some delicious camp food to relish.
