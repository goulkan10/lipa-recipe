This ricotta is visually thicker and creamier compared to others. Shio Koji&#39;s convenience is another reason this traditional ingredient recaptured the spotlight in Japan. Not only is it necessary in fermentation, but when combined with other ingredients, it can be used for flavoring, curing and/or preserving foods. When I say this only takes a half hour, I should clarify that most of that time is actually hands-off. Strain the curds: Set a strainer over a bowl and line the strainer with cheese cloth.
