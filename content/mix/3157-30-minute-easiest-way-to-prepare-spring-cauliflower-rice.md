Becoming A Healthy Eater

    
Camp cooking can be as complicated or simple as you would like it to be. If you want to prepare quick and simple but nutritious meals as you're camping, camp cooking does not even have to require a fire. But if you're thinking about fueling your camping excursion having a feast, then camp cooking can allow you to make hot, healthy foods which are as great as you can make them at home in your kitchen.

Camp cooking doesn't need to be limited to sandwiches and baked potatoes wrapped in aluminum foil.  Almost any cooking system you are using from the kitchen can be duplicated around the campfire. For instance, use a dutch oven or pit cooking to consume your meals. You could also easily bake foods in a bowl over a grill, or boil, braise and beverage. Which sort of camping cookware is ideal for you? Camp cooking and clean-up may be easy or a hassle, it all starts with great camping gear.

Some pots/pans come in places that partner together or"nest" for storage and also let you tuck a spoonful of gas within them. This comes in handy when you're wanting to save space whilst camping.

Listed below are some camping things to consider with you if you're thinking about preparing some meals around the home. These frequent kitchen items allow you to duplicate tasty meals when you are out of doors.

• Salt and pepper
• Other of your favorite herbs and spices
• Cooking oil
• Pot holder

• Aluminum foil
• Tongs and spatula
• Cutting knives
• Cutting board
• Mixing bowl
• Paper or plastic silverware, plates and cups

If you have just a few campers and are looking for some simple camp cooking, try the simple and speedy technique of tin could cooking. All you'll need is a fresh tin can -- a one gallon size can works nicely. Your source of heat can be a little campfire, or if wood burning is illegal, a little buddy burner may work well, which can be found at sporting good stores or online. Place your meal from the tin can and easily heat the contents of your can over a flame.  This technique works great for soups, beans and tuna fish.

A more time-consuming pub cooking technique which also produces tasty meals is pit cooking. Pit cooking is terrific for items which could be wrapped in aluminum foil to be cooked.  It is also a great camp cooking system if you are using a dutch oven or cast iron cookware. Pit cooking warms your meals by heating rocks and coals which are buried in the ground. As the stones cool away, their emitted heat cooks the meals. To pit cook, first dig a hole that's about three times bigger than your own cookware. Line the pit with stones and create a fire in the center. Once the flame has burned rapidly for approximately one hour, push the warm coals and rocks into the center. Twist your wrapped meals or covered skillets on top of the rocks and coals and put on top. After a couple of hours, you will have some delicious camp food to enjoy.
