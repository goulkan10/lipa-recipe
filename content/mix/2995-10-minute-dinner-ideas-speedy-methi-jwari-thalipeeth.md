Getting A Healthy Eater

    
Camp cooking can be as complicated or simple as you would like it to be. If you want to prepare quick and easy but healthy meals as you are camping, camp cooking does not even have to need a fire. But if you're interested in ridding your camping trip having a feast, then camp cooking can make it possible for you to earn hot, healthy foods which are as good as you can make them at home in your own kitchen.

Camp cooking doesn't need to be limited to sandwiches and baked potatoes wrapped in aluminum foil.  Almost any cooking procedure you use in the kitchen could be replicated around the home. For example, use a dutch oven or pit cooking to bake your meals. You can also easily fry foods at a bowl over a grill, or boil, braise and beverage. Which type of camping cookware is best for you? Camp cooking and cleanup may be easy or a hassle, it all starts with great camping equipment.

Some pots/pans arrive in places that mate together or"nest" for storage and even allow you to tuck a spoonful of gas within them. This really also comes in handy when you're trying to save space while camping.

Following are some camping things to consider with you if you're considering preparing some meals around the home. These common kitchen items will allow you to replicate yummy meals as you're out of doorways.


• Other of your favorite herbs and spices
• Cooking oil
• Pot holder

• Aluminum foil
• Tongs and spatula
• Cutting knives
• Cutting board
• Mixing bowl
• Paper or plastic silverware, plates and cups

When you have only a couple of campers and are looking for some very simple camp cooking, try out the simple and fast technique of tin may cooking. All you'll need is a fresh tin can -- a one gallon size may works nicely. Your source of warmth can be a little campfire, or when wood burning is illegal, a small buddy burner may work well, which can be found at sporting good stores or online. Place your meal in the tin can and easily warm the contents of your can over a fire. You'll have a hot meal ready in minutes.  This technique works great for sauces, beans and tuna fish.

A more time-consuming camp cooking technique which also produces yummy food is pit cooking. Pit cooking is fantastic for items that can be wrapped in aluminum foil to be cooked.  It is also a wonderful camp cooking method if you are using a dutch oven or cast iron cookware. Pit cooking warms your meals by heating rocks and coals which are buried in the ground. As the rocks cool off, their emitted heat cooks the meals. To pit cook, first dig a hole that's about three times larger than your own cookware. Line the pit with stones and construct a fire in the center. When the fire has burnt rapidly for about an hourpush the warm coals and stone into the center. Layer your wrapped meals covered skillets in addition to the rocks and coals and place more on top. Following a number of hours, you will have some delicious camp food to relish.
