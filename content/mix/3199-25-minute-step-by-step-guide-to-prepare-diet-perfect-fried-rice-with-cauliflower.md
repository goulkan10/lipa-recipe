It is SO TASTY my kids thought it was real rice. Healthy, low carb, super light and flavourful. Using minced cauliflower instead of rice, this &#34;fried rice&#34; is a great way to get your veggies. We prefer the texture of hand minced cauliflower, but you can always mince it in a food processor or buy it pre-minced. If using a food processor, be careful not to process it too much or else the cauliflower will.
