A bagel is a excellent way to begin the day.

We are right in the middle of deer hunting season here. Like always, I am scrambling to use up the remnants of last year&#39;s meat harvest before filling the freezer with more. Remove butcher paper or plastic wrapping from frozen venison and place inside the pot. Sprinkle over one Tablespoon of onion soup mix per pound of meat. Remove meat for carving and bring liquid to a boil.
