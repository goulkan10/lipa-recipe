One of those featured was meatloaf cupcakes with mashed potato &#34;frosting.&#34; The bakery that sells them has another interesting item in its menu — meatloaf cupcakes with spaghetti &#34;frosting.&#34; The mashed potato &#34;frosting&#34; was doable (i.e., within my skills); the spaghetti &#34;frosting&#34; would make too much mess. Besides, the meatloaf and spaghetti combo sounded too heavy a meal. While the meatloaf is cooking, make the mashed potatoes. Mix ground beef, saltine crackers, onion, green bell pepper, milk, egg, Worcestershire sauce, garlic, black pepper, and seasoned salt together in a bowl. Pop meatloaf cupcakes out the tin and place onto serving plate.
