Getting A Healthy Eater

    
Camp cooking can be as complicated or simple as you want it to be. If you would like to prepare quick and simple but healthy meals when you are swimming, camp cooking does not even need to require a flame. However, if you are interested in fueling your camping trip using a feast, camp cooking can make it possible for you to make hot, healthy foods which are as good as you can create them at home in your kitchen.

Camp cooking doesn't need to be limited to sandwiches and baked potatoes wrapped in aluminum foil.  Almost any cooking procedure you use in the kitchen can be replicated around the campfire. For example, use a toaster or pit cooking to bake your meals. You could also easily bake foods in a bowl over a grill, or boil, braise and roast. Which type of camping cookware is best for you? Camp cooking and clean-up may be easy or a hassle, and it all starts with great camping gear.

Some pots/pans arrive in sets that partner jointly or"nest" for storage and even let you tuck a spoonful of fuel inside them. This comes in handy when you're looking to save room whilst camping.

Listed below are some camping items to carry with you if you are planning on preparing some meals around the home. These common kitchen items allow you to duplicate tasty meals while you are out of doorways.

• Salt and pepper
• Other your favourite herbs and spices
• Cooking oil
• Pot holder

• Aluminum foil

• Cutting knives
• Cutting board
• Mixing bowl
• Paper or plastic silverware, plates and cups

If you have only a couple campers and are looking for some simple camp cooking, try out the easy and fast technique of tin can cooking. All you'll need is a clean tin can -- a 1 gallon size can works nicely. Your source of heat can be a little campfire, or if wood burning is illegal, a little buddy burner will work nicely, which can be seen at sporting good stores or online. Place your meal from the tin could and easily warm the contents of your can over a flame.  This technique works great for sauces, beans and poultry.

A more time-consuming camp cooking technique that also produces tasty food is pit cooking.  It is also a excellent camp cooking system if you are using a dutch oven or cast iron cookware. Pit cooking warms your food by heating stones and coals which are buried in the ground. As the stones cool off, their emitted heat cooks the meals. To pit cook, first dig a hole that is about three times larger than your own cookware. Line the pit with rocks and build a fire in the middle. When the flame has burned rapidly for approximately an hourpush the hot coals and stones into the middle. Layer your wrapped food or covered skillets on top of the rocks and coals and place more on top. Following a couple of hours, you'll have some tasty camp food to enjoy.
