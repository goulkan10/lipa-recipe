During my last pregnancy, I lived pretty close to an Arby&#39;s. Milkshakes are seriously one of my family&#39;s favorite treats! And I love that I can save time and money by making delicious homemade milkshakes myself! After the strawberry lemonade, I made milkshake with the remaining strawberries.
