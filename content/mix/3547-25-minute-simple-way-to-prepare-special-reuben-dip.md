Becoming A Healthy Eater

    
Camp cooking can be as complicated or simple as you want it to be. If you would like to prepare fast and easy but nutritious meals while you're camping, camp cooking does not even need to need a fire. However, if you're thinking about ridding your camping trip with a feast, then camp cooking can make it possible for you to earn warm, healthy foods which are as good as you can make them at home in your own kitchen.

Camp cooking does not have to be limited to sandwiches and baked potatoes wrapped in aluminum foil.  Almost any cooking method you use from the kitchen can be duplicated around the campfire. For instance, use a toaster or pit cooking to bake your food. You can also easily bake foods at a bowl over a grill, or boil, braise and roast. Which kind of camping cookware is ideal for you? Camp cooking and clean-up may be easy or a hassle, it all starts with great camping gear.

Some pots/pans arrive in sets that mate collectively or"nest" for storage and even allow you to tuck a canister of gas within them. This comes in handy once you're wanting to save room whilst camping.

Following are some camping items to carry with you if you're planning on preparing some meals around the home. These frequent kitchen items will allow you to replicate yummy meals while you're out of doorways.

• Salt and pepper
• Other of your favourite herbs and spices
• Cooking oil
• Pot holder
• Hand-held can opener
• Aluminum foil

• Cutting knives
• Cutting board
• Mixing bowl


If you have only a couple campers and are looking for some easy camp cooking, try the easy and fast technique of tin may cooking. All you will need is a fresh tin can -- a one gallon size may works well. Your source of heat may be little campfire, or if wood burning is illegal, a little buddy burner will work nicely, which may be located at sporting good stores or online. Put your meal in the tin could and simply warm the contents of your can over a flame. You'll have a hot meal ready in minutes.  This technique works great for sauces, beans and poultry.

A more time-consuming camp cooking technique which also produces tasty food is pit cooking.  It's also a wonderful camp cooking system if you are using a dutch oven or cast iron cookware. Pit cooking warms your meals by heating rocks and coals which are buried in the floor. As the rocks cool , their emitted heat cooks the food. To pit cook, first dig a hole that is approximately three times bigger than your own cookware. Line the pit with rocks and create a fire in the middle. When the fire has burnt rapidly for about an hour, push the hot coals and stone into the middle. Twist your wrapped meals or covered skillets on top of the stones and coals and place more on top. After a couple of hours, you will have some delicious camp food to enjoy.
