Learn how to use some of these heat generating equipment in your kitchen, such as the crock pot, to be able to truly beat the summertime and keep your cool while preparing a great warm meal for friends and loved ones.

So, how does crock pot cooking really help overcome the heat? Simply put, that the crock pot in and of itself sets off much less heat when cooking compared to the oven or stove . This is the very first and possibly the very best reason to use the crock pot on summer time meal planning. You should also consider the fact that by not heating your house by utilizing your stove top or oven you're also avoiding your air conditioning (or additional heating systems ) from working overtime so as to compensate for the extra heat which other cooking systems introduce.

This leaves crock pot cooking a win-win situation since the costs involved in managing a crock pot are much less than the expenses related to operating a stove or oven in general. Whether gas or electric, your cooker and oven tend to be serious energy hogs.

So often, when preparing a meal at the last moment, vegetables and other side dishes have been made in favour of expedience. Crock pot cooking in many cases is really a meal in 1 dish.

One other fantastic reason to use a crock pot for the summer cooking is the ease of clean up.  Unlike vegetables and pans, most crock pot foods are made in one dish. This usually means that there will not be mountains of meals to be hand cleaned or packed into the dishwasher (or if you're like me-both) later. You can spend less time cleaning just as you spent less time slaving over a hot stove. Oh wait! Ensure time slaving over a hot stove. After tidy is complete you can get back to enjoying the sun set, pursuing the lightening bugs with your small ones, or even waiting for the very first star.

While there will never be a one size fits all ideal cooking system, crock pot cooking comes very near. If you have a crock pot collecting dust somewhere in the back of your pantry it is time to get it out, dust if offand dig up some great summer crock pot cooking recipes.
