However, if you're considering ridding your camping trip with a feast, camp cooking can make it possible for you to make hot, healthy foods that are as great as you can create them at home in your kitchen.

Camp cooking does not have to be limited to sandwiches and baked potatoes wrapped in aluminum foil.  Just about any cooking process you use from the kitchen could be replicated around the home. For example, use a dutch oven or pit cooking to consume your food. You can also easily fry foods in a bowl over a grill, or boil, braise and beverage. Which kind of camping cookware is best for you?

When the fire has burned rapidly for about an hourpush the hot coals and rocks into the center. Twist your wrapped meals covered skillets on top of the rocks and coals and place on top.
