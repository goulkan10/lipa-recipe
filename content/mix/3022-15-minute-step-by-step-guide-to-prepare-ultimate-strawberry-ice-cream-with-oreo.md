It's possible to spend less time cleaning as you spent time slaving over a hot cooker. Oh wait! Ensure time slaving over a hot stove. After tidy is complete you can get back to enjoying the sunshine set, pursuing the lightening bugs with your little ones, or even waiting for your first star.

While there will never be a one size fits all best cooking method, crock pot cooking comes really close. If you've got a crock pot collecting dust somewhere at the back of your pantry it is the right time to get it out, dust off, and dig up some wonderful summer crock pot cooking recipes.
