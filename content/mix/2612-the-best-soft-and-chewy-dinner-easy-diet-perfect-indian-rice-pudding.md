<i>Before you jump to Indian Rice Pudding recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about {<strong>The Basics of Being Healthy</strong>.</i>
Getting A Healthy Eater

Whether your traveling on the go or round the
House, you don't need to provide up healthy eating
Simply because you are on the run. The Truth Is,
Healthy eating is even more significant when your


Having a good diet will help your body to handle
Stress better. As you hustle around, a healthy meal
Is most likely the very last thing you consider. The
Following ideas can help you eat if your on the go.

Restaurants
With tempting selections, large parts, and a festive
Air, it's easy to skip healthy eating. It's
Okay to splurge every now and then, even though you'll
Pack a great deal of weight should you make it a habit.
When you eat out at restaurants, consistently be smart
about it.

Airports
An airport can be a very stressful place, though 
You shouldn't scrap your diet because of it. Eat
Since you're hungry, not due to stress,
Boredom, or even to kill time.

In your Vehicle 
Maintain some healthy snacks in your car at all times,
So that when you get hungry - you have them.

At home
Evenings and mornings are busy times in most houses.
Earning the time to consume can be difficult, although you
Shouldn't run out the door without eating breakfast
first. Cereal with milk, a banana, muffin, or even
A bagel is a superb way to start the day.

Anytime you are on the move, always Make Certain That you
Make the ideal food choices. 
Food with you if you will need to, so you have it
When you need it. Eating healthy on the go is easy
To do, when you understand how. Never sacrifice healthy
Food for junk, as your own system will regret it afterwards.

##### The ingredients needed to cook Indian Rice Pudding:

1. Take 2 cup Basmati or other long grain white rice

1. You need 1/2 cup Sugar
1. Prepare 2 tsp Ground cardamom
1. Take 1 cup Golden raisins
1. You need 1 cup Chopped pistachios or almonds


##### Steps to make Indian Rice Pudding:

1. Cook the rice with 3.5 cups water. Set aside.
1. In a large nonstick pan, heat the rice and milk until boiling.
1. Reduce to a simmer and stir until slightly thickened, about 5 minutes.

Put the milk and coconut milk in a heavy-bottomed saucepan. Heat the milk with the pierced green cardamom pods in a sturdy pan. Stir often to prevent the rice scorching on the bottom of the pan. In a deep, non-stick pan, combine the pudding rice, milk and sugar and bring to a full simmer. Turn down the heat to a moderate simmer before adding the saffron and ground cardamom.
