Getting A Healthy Eater

    
Camp cooking can be as complicated or simple as you want it to be. If you want to prepare quick and simple but nutritious meals while you're camping, camp cooking doesn't even have to need a fire. But if you are thinking about fueling your camping excursion with a feast, then camp cooking can allow you to earn hot, healthy foods that are as good as you can create them at home in your kitchen.

Camp cooking does not have to be limited to sandwiches and baked potatoes wrapped in aluminum foil.  Almost any cooking procedure you are using from the kitchen could be duplicated around the campfire. For instance, use a dutch oven or pit cooking to bake your meals. You might also easily bake foods at a bowl over a grill, or boil, braise and beverage. Which type of camping cookware is ideal for you? Camp cooking and clean-up may be easy or a hassle, it all starts with great camping equipment.

Some pots/pans come in places that partner together or"nest" for storage and even allow you to tuck a canister of fuel inside them. This really comes in handy once you're seeking to save space while camping.

Following are some camping items to carry with you if you are planning on preparing some meals around the home. These common kitchen items allow you to replicate yummy meals as you are out of doors.

• Salt and pepper
• Other of your favorite herbs and spices
• Cooking oil
• Pot holder

• Aluminum foil
• Tongs and spatula
• Cutting knives
• Cutting board
• Mixing bowl


If you have only a couple campers and are searching for some very easy camp cooking, try the easy and speedy technique of tin could cooking. All you will need is a clean tin can -- a 1 gallon size can works well. Your source of warmth may be small campfire, or when wood burning is illegal, a small buddy burner may work well, which may be found at sporting good stores or online. Put your meal in the tin can and simply warm the contents of your can over a flame. You will have a hot meal ready in seconds.  This technique works great for sauces, beans and poultry.

A more time-consuming camp cooking technique which also produces tasty food is pit cooking. Pit cooking is terrific for items that can be wrapped in aluminum foil to be cooked.  It is also a wonderful camp cooking method if you're using a dutch oven or cast iron cookware. Pit cooking warms your meals by heating rocks and coals that are buried in the floor. As the rocks cool off, their emitted heat cooks the meals. To pit cookfirst dig a hole that's about three times larger than your cookware. Line the pit with stones and build a fire in the center. Once the fire has burnt rapidly for about an hourpush the warm coals and rocks into the center. Layer your wrapped meals covered skillets on top of the rocks and coals and put on top. After a few hours, you will have some delicious camp food to enjoy.
