Getting A Healthy Eater

    
Camp cooking can be as elaborate or simple as you would like it to be. If you would like to prepare quick and easy but healthy meals as you are camping, camp cooking doesn't even need to require a flame. But if you are interested in fueling your camping trip with a feast, camp cooking can enable you to earn warm, healthy foods that are as good as you can make them at home in your own kitchen.

Camp cooking does not need to be limited to sandwiches and baked potatoes wrapped in aluminum foil.  Just about any cooking process you use in the kitchen can be duplicated around the campfire. For example, use a toaster or pit cooking to consume your food. You may also easily bake foods in a bowl over a grill, or boil, braise and roast. Which type of camping cookware is best for you? Camp cooking and clean-up may be easy or a hassle, it all starts with great camping gear.

Some pots/pans come in sets that partner together or"nest" for storage and also allow you to tuck a canister of fuel inside them. This really comes in handy when you're seeking to save space whilst camping.

Following are some camping items to take with you if you are considering preparing some meals around the campfire. These frequent kitchen items will allow you to duplicate tasty meals while you're out of doors.

• Salt and pepper
• Other of your favorite herbs and spices
• Cooking oil
• Pot holder
• Hand-held can opener
• Aluminum foil
• Tongs and spatula
• Cutting knives
• Cutting board
• Mixing bowl
• Paper or plastic silverware, plates and cups

When you have only a few campers and are searching for some simple camp cooking, try out the easy and speedy technique of tin could cooking. All you'll need is a clean tin can -- a one gallon size may works nicely. Your source of heat can be a little campfire, or if wood burning is prohibited, a small buddy burner may work nicely, which may be found at sporting good stores or online. Put your meal in the tin could and simply heat the contents of your own can over a fire.  This technique works great for sauces, beans and poultry.

A more time-consuming camp cooking technique that also produces tasty meals is pit cooking. Pit cooking is terrific for items that can be wrapped in aluminum foil to be cooked.  It's also a wonderful camp cooking system if you're using a dutch oven or cast iron cookware. Pit cooking warms your food by heating rocks and coals that are concealed in the floor. As the stones cool off, their emitted heat cooks the meals. To pit cook, first dig a hole that's approximately three times bigger than your own cookware. Line the pit with rocks and construct a fire in the center. Once the flame has burned rapidly for approximately one hour, push the hot coals and stone into the middle. Layer your wrapped food or covered skillets in addition to the stones and coals and place on top. After a couple of hours, you'll have some tasty camp food to relish.
