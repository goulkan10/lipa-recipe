Camp cooking can be as complicated or simple as you would like it to be. If you wish to prepare quick and simple but healthy meals as you're camping, camp cooking doesn't even have to need a fire. However, if you're considering fueling your camping trip with a feast, then camp cooking can allow you to make hot, healthy foods which are as great as you can create them at home in your own kitchen.

Camp cooking doesn't need to be limited to sandwiches and baked potatoes wrapped in aluminum foil.  Almost any cooking process you use from the kitchen could be duplicated around the home. For example, use a dutch oven or pit cooking to bake your food. You may also easily fry foods in a pan over a grill, or boil, braise and roast. Which sort of camping cookware is best for you? Camp cooking and cleanup may be easy or a hassle, and it all starts with great camping equipment.

Some pots/pans come in sets that mate collectively or"nest" for storage and also allow you to tuck a spoonful of fuel inside them. This really comes in handy when you're wanting to save room whilst camping.

Listed below are some camping items to consider with you if you're considering preparing some meals around the campfire. These frequent kitchen items will allow you to replicate yummy meals when you're out of doorways.

• Salt and pepper
• Other of your favourite herbs and spices
• Cooking oil
• Pot holder
• Hand-held can opener
• Aluminum foil
• Tongs and spatula
• Cutting knives
• Cutting board
• Mixing bowl
• Paper or plastic silverware, plates and cups

In case you have only a few campers and are searching for some simple camp cooking, try out the simple and speedy technique of tin could cooking. All you'll need is a clean tin can -- a one gallon size may works well.

Put your meal from the tin can and easily warm the contents of your can over a fire.  This technique works great for soups, beans and poultry.

A more time-consuming pub cooking technique which also produces yummy food is pit cooking. Pit cooking is fantastic for items which could be wrapped in aluminum foil to be cooked.  It is also a wonderful camp cooking system if you are using a dutch oven or cast iron cookware. Pit cooking calms your meals by heating stones and coals that are buried in the ground. As the rocks cool off, their emitted heat cooks the food. To pit cookfirst dig a hole that's about three times bigger than your cookware. Line the pit with rocks and create a fire in the middle. Once the fire has burnt rapidly for approximately an hourpush the warm coals and rocks into the middle. Twist your wrapped meals covered skillets in addition to the stones and coals and place more on top. After a number of hours, you'll have some tasty camp food to enjoy.
