Camp cooking can be as elaborate or simple as you want it to be. If you wish to prepare fast and simple but nutritious meals while you're camping, camp cooking doesn't even have to require a flame. However, if you're considering fueling your camping excursion having a feast, camp cooking can make it possible for you to make warm, healthy foods which are as good as you can create them at home in your own kitchen.

Camp cooking does not have to be limited to sandwiches and baked potatoes wrapped in aluminum foil.  Almost any cooking procedure you are using in the kitchen could be duplicated around the campfire. For example, use a dutch oven or pit cooking to bake your food. You might also easily fry foods in a bowl over a grill, or boil, braise and roast. What kind of camping cookware is ideal for you? Camp cooking and clean-up may be easy or a hassle, and it all starts with great camping gear.

Some pots/pans come in sets that mate collectively or"nest" for storage and also let you tuck a spoonful of gas within them. This really also comes in handy when you're looking to save room while camping.

Listed below are some camping things to consider with you if you are planning on preparing some meals around the home. These common kitchen items will allow you to replicate yummy meals as you're out of doors.

• Cooking oil
• Pot holder

• Aluminum foil
• Tongs and spatula
• Cutting knives

When you have only a couple of campers and are looking for some simple camp cooking, try the easy and quick technique of tin may cooking. All you will need is a fresh tin can -- a 1 gallon size can works nicely. Your source of heat may be small campfire, or when wood burning is prohibited, a little buddy burner will work well, which can be seen at sporting good stores or online. Put your meal in the tin could and just warm the contents of your can over a fire. You will have a hot meal ready in seconds.  This technique works great for soups, beans and tuna fish.

A more time-consuming camp cooking technique that also produces tasty food is pit cooking. Pit cooking is very good for items that can be wrapped in aluminum foil to be cooked.  It's also a wonderful camp cooking method if you're using a dutch oven or cast iron cookware. Pit cooking calms your food by heating stones and coals that are buried in the floor. As the rocks cool , their emitted heat cooks the food. To pit cook, first dig a hole that is about three times bigger than your cookware. Line the pit with stones and build a fire in the middle. Once the flame has burned rapidly for about an hour, push the hot coals and stones into the middle. Twist your wrapped food or covered skillets on top of the rocks and coals and put on top. Following a number of hours, you will have some delicious camp food to enjoy.
