Cranberry Vinaigrette #SundaySupper, Chocolate Sour Cream Cookies, Chocolate Chunk Pecan… No bake oatmeal/chocolate cookies. Stuff mini marshmallows inside each cookie—I recommend vegan marshmallows because they stay fluffy when baked—and suddenly you have transformed the ordinary into the extraordinary. To an unsuspecting guest, they look like your average chocolate chip cookies… So imagine their surprise. These cookies take just minutes of work; most of the time is spent waiting for them to harden into the rich, nutty, chocolaty delights that they are. Add the oats, peanut butter, vanilla and salt, and stir to combine.
