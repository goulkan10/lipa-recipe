Here is the first and maybe the best reason to use the crock pot on summer time meal planning. You should also look at the fact that by not heating your house by employing your stove top or oven you are also preventing your air conditioning (or other cooling methods) from working overtime in order to compensate for the additional heat that other cooking methods introduce.

This makes crock pot cooking a win-win scenario as the costs involved with managing a crock pot are much less than the expenses related to operating a cooker or stove generally. Whether gas or electric, your cooker and oven tend to be considerable energy hogs. Add to that the fact that you're not increasing the warmth in your house by traditional way of cooking and you are using even less electricity.

Unfortunately for many, the general consensus was that crock pots were meant for comfort foods and hearty winter foods.  The reality is that the crock pot ought to be one of your best loved and most frequently utilized cooking techniques in the event that it's possible to handle it.  Virtually anything that can be boiled could be reached in the crock pot and many, many more lovely and enticing foods and treats too.

Second, many good crock pot recipes include the vegetables that guarantee we're getting the nutrients we need. So often, when preparing a meal at the last moment, vegetables and other side dishes have been left out in favor of expedience. Crock pot cooking many cases is really a meal in 1 dish.

Another fantastic reason to use a crock pot for the summer cooking is the ease of clean up.  Unlike pots and pans, most crock pot dishes are made in one dish. This means that there will not be mountains of meals to be hand cleaned or packed into the dishwasher (or in case you're like me-both) later. It's possible to spend less time cleaning as you spent time slaving over a hot cooker. Oh wait! Make that time slaving over a hot stove. After clean up is complete you can contact enjoying the sun set, pursuing the lightening bugs with your small ones, or even waiting for the very first celebrity.

While there will be no one size fits all ideal cooking system, crock pot cooking comes really close. When you have a crock pot collecting dust somewhere at the rear of your pantry it is time to get out it, dust in the offand dig up some great summertime crock pot cooking recipes.
