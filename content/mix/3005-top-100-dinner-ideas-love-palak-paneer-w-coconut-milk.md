This usually means that there won't be mountains of meals to be hand cleaned or packed to the dishwasher (or if you are like me-both) later. You can spend less time cleaning as you spent time slaving over a hot stove. Oh wait! Ensure time slaving over a hot stove. Once tidy is complete you can contact enjoying the sun set, chasing the lightening bugs with your little ones, or waiting for the first superstar.
