Becoming A Healthy Eater

    
Camp cooking can be as elaborate or simple as you would like it to be. If you want to prepare quick and easy but healthy meals while you're camping, camp cooking doesn't even have to need a fire. However, if you are considering fueling your camping excursion with a feast, then camp cooking can make it possible for you to make hot, healthy foods which are as good as you can create them at home in your kitchen.

Camp cooking does not have to be limited to sandwiches and baked potatoes wrapped in aluminum foil.  Just about any cooking procedure you are using in the kitchen could be duplicated around the campfire. For instance, use a toaster or pit cooking to consume your food. You might also easily fry foods in a pan over a grill, or boil, braise and beverage. What kind of camping cookware is best for you? Camp cooking and cleanup can be easy or a hassle, but it all starts with great camping equipment.

Some pots/pans come in places that mate together or"nest" for storage and also let you tuck a spoonful of gas within them. This really comes in handy once you're seeking to save space whilst camping.

Following are some camping items to take with you if you're planning on preparing some meals around the campfire. These common kitchen items will allow you to duplicate tasty meals as you are out of doors.


â€¢ Other of your favourite herbs and spices
â€¢ Cooking oil
â€¢ Pot holder

â€¢ Aluminum foil
â€¢ Tongs and spatula
â€¢ Cutting knives
â€¢ Cutting board
â€¢ Mixing bowl


If you have just a couple of campers and are searching for some very simple camp cooking, try the easy and fast technique of tin can cooking. All you will need is a clean tin can -- a 1 gallon size can works nicely. Your source of warmth may be small campfire, or if wood burning is illegal, a little buddy burner will work nicely, which may be found at sporting good stores or online. Put your meal from the tin can and easily warm the contents of your own can over a fire.  This technique works great for soups, beans and poultry.

A more time-consuming pub cooking technique that also produces tasty food is pit cooking.  It is also a excellent camp cooking method if you are using a dutch oven or cast iron cookware. Pit cooking warms your food by heating stones and coals that are concealed in the ground. As the stones cool off, their emitted heat cooks the meals. To pit cook, first dig a hole that's roughly three times larger than your own cookware. Line the pit with rocks and create a fire in the middle. Once the flame has burnt rapidly for about one hourpush the hot coals and stones into the center. Layer your wrapped meals or covered skillets on top of the stones and coals and put on top. After a few hours, you will have some tasty camp food to relish.
