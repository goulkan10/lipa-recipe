<i>Before you jump to Biscuits and gravy recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about {<strong>The Basics of Being Healthy</strong>.</i>
Getting A Healthy Eater

Whether your traveling on the go or around the
House, you do not need to provide up healthy eating
Simply because you are on the run. The Truth Is,
Healthy eating is even more important when your
Trying to keep up with a busy schedule.


Stress better. As you hustle about, a healthy meal
Is most likely the last thing you think about. The
Following ideas can help you eat if your on the move.

Restaurants
With tempting menus, large portions, and a festive
Air, it's easy to skip healthy eating. It is 
Ok to splurge every now and then, even though you'll
Pack on a lot of weight if you make it a habit.
If you eat out at restaurants, always be smart
about it.

Airports
An airport may be a very stressful area, though 
You should not squander your diet because of it. Eat
Because you are hungry, not because of anxiety,
Boredom, or even to kill time.

In your car

So that when you become hungry - you have them.

At home
Evenings and mornings are busy days in many homes.
Obtaining the time to consume could be hard, although you
Shouldn't run outside the door without even eating breakfast
first. 
That a bagel is a good way to begin the day.

Anytime you are on the go, always make sure that you
Make the ideal food decisions. 
Food with you in case you need to, so that you have it
When you require it. Eating healthy on the move is easy
To do, once you know how. Never sacrifice healthy
Food for crap, since your own system will regret it later.

Traditional Biscuits and Gravy is a Southern breakfast dish that consists of soft dough biscuits smothered in a rich, creamy gravy. The gravy is made from the drippings of pork sausage, along with flour, milk, and the bits of cooked sausage. How to make Biscuits and Gravy from Scratch: How to make biscuits and sausage gravy: First make your biscuits -whisk together the flour, baking powder, sugar, salt, and cream of tartar. Add the butter into the bowl and work it in until well incorporated (I cheat and use a cheese grater!).
