However, if you are interested in ridding your camping trip using a feast, then camp cooking can allow you to make warm, healthy foods which are as good as you can create them at home in your own kitchen.

Camp cooking does not need to be limited to sandwiches and baked potatoes wrapped in aluminum foil.  Almost any cooking method you use in the kitchen can be replicated around the campfire. For instance, use a toaster or pit cooking to consume your meals. You might also easily fry foods in a bowl over a grill, or boil, braise and beverage. What kind of camping cookware is best for you? Camp cooking and cleanup can be easy or a hassle, it all starts with great camping equipment.

If you have just a couple of campers and are looking for some simple camp cooking, try out the easy and fast technique of tin can cooking. All you'll need is a fresh tin can -- a one gallon size can works nicely. Your source of heat may be small campfire, or when wood burning is prohibited, a small buddy burner may work well, which may be seen at sporting good stores or online. Place your meal from the tin can and simply warm the contents of your can over a flame.  This technique works great for soups, beans and poultry.

A more time-consuming pub cooking technique which also produces delectable meals is pit cooking.  It's also a excellent camp cooking method if you're using a dutch oven or cast iron cookware. Pit cooking calms your food by heating rocks and coals which are buried in the floor. As the stones cool away, their emitted heat cooks the food. To pit cook, first dig a hole that is about three times bigger than your cookware. Line the pit with stones and build a fire in the center. Once the fire has burnt rapidly for about one hourpush the hot coals and rocks into the center. Twist your wrapped food or covered skillets in addition to the stones and coals and put more on top. After a few hours, you will have some tasty camp food to enjoy.
