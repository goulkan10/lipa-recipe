This is the very first and maybe the very best reason to use the crock pot in summer time meal preparation.

Secondly, many great crock pot recipes incorporate the vegetables that guarantee we're getting the nutrients that we need. So often, when planning a meal in the last moment, vegetables and other side dishes are left out in favour of expedience. Crock pot cooking many cases is a meal in one dish.

Another fantastic reason to use a crock pot for your summertime cooking is that the ease of clean up.  Unlike pans and pans, many crock pot meals are created in one dish. This usually means that there isn't going to be mountains of meals to be either hand cleaned or packed to the dishwasher (or if you're like me-both) afterwards. It's possible to spend less time cleaning just as you spent time slaving over a hot cooker. Oh wait! Make that no time slaving over a hot stove. After tidy is complete you can contact enjoying the sun set, pursuing the lightening bugs along with your little ones, or even waiting for your very first superstar.

While there will never be a one size fits all very ideal cooking process, crock pot cooking comes really close. When you have a crock pot gathering dust somewhere at the back of your pantry it is the right time to get out it, dust if off, and dig some excellent summertime crock pot cooking recipes.
