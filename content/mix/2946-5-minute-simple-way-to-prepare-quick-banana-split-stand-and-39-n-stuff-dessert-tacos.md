Can I tell you that this dessert has been in the making for over two years? I was brainstorming a dessert for our family reunion two years ago and had tried. dessert taco - Peter Jackson shares an interesting recipe of a dessert taco on the Foreign Policy website. The next step in making the dessert tacos is stuffing the soft shell with ice cream and putting the banana in. Afterward, one may finish off with some chocolate spread and sprinkles. We have savory tacos, we have breakfast tacos and now, without further ado, we have dessert tacos -- ones that go beyond the famous frozen Choco Taco that is the clear star of ice cream trucks around America.
