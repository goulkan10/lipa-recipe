Please don&#39;t report me, or the studio. These copycat Red Lobster cheddar bay biscuits are made from scratch (no baking mix here!), are buttery, cheesy, light and flaky, and loaded with garlic-herb flavor - even better than the original! Lightly mist a large baking sheet with cooking spray. Make the biscuits: Pulse the flour, baking powder, sugar and salt in. Cut in butter with a pastry blender until mixture resembles coarse crumbs, with some pea-size lumps.
