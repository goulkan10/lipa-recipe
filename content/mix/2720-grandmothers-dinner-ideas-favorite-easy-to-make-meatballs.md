It's possible for people to make healthy food options even if they only have a brief time in which to prepare their meals.

Fresh fruits and vegetables are more diverse than ever before due to developments in transportation and preservation methods.  All types of cuisine can be prepared quickly because of the choices of fresh goods as opposed to frozen foods. There are numerous choices among frozen foods as well. The demand for healthy frozen dinners and other foods has increased alongside demands for greater variety in frozen food offerings. Any frozen food aisle at any supermarket will show as lots of healthy food options and bad choices. The choice is left up to the person.
