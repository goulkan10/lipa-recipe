Camp cooking can be as elaborate or simple as you would like it to be. If you wish to prepare quick and simple but healthy meals as you are camping, camp cooking does not even have to need a fire. But if you are considering fueling your camping trip having a feast, then camp cooking can enable you to earn warm, healthy foods which are as great as you can create them at home in your own kitchen.

Camp cooking does not need to be limited to sandwiches and baked potatoes wrapped in aluminum foil.  Almost any cooking procedure you use in the kitchen could be replicated around the campfire. For example, use a toaster or pit cooking to bake your food. You can also easily bake foods at a pan over a grill, or boil, braise and roast. What kind of camping cookware is best for you? Camp cooking and clean-up can be easy or a hassle, it all starts with great camping gear.

Some pots/pans arrive in sets that mate together or"nest" for storage and also let you tuck a spoonful of fuel inside them. This also comes in handy when you're searching to save room while camping.

Following are some camping things to carry with you if you're considering preparing some meals around the campfire. These common kitchen items allow you to duplicate tasty meals as you're out of doors.


• Other of your favorite herbs and spices
• Cooking oil
• Pot holder
• Hand-held can opener
• Aluminum foil

• Cutting knives
• Cutting board
• Mixing bowl


When you have just a few campers and are looking for some simple camp cooking, try out the simple and speedy technique of tin may cooking. All you'll need is a fresh tin can -- a one gallon size may works nicely. Your source of heat can be a little campfire, or when wood burning is illegal, a little buddy burner will work nicely, which can be located at sporting good stores or online. Place your meal from the tin could and easily heat the contents of your can over a flame. You'll have a hot meal ready in seconds.  This technique works great for soups, beans and tuna fish.

A more time-consuming pub cooking technique that also produces yummy food is pit cooking. Pit cooking is wonderful for items that may be wrapped in aluminum foil to be cooked.  It's also a great camp cooking system if you are using a dutch oven or cast iron cookware. Pit cooking warms your meals by heating rocks and coals which are concealed in the floor. As the stones cool away, their emitted heat cooks the food. To pit cookfirst dig a hole that is approximately three times larger than your cookware. Line the pit with stones and construct a fire in the center. When the flame has burnt rapidly for about an hourpush the hot coals and stone into the center. Twist your wrapped meals covered skillets on top of the rocks and coals and put on top. Following a number of hours, you'll have some tasty camp food to enjoy.
