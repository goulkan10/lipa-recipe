However, if you're interested in ridding your camping excursion using a feast, then camp cooking can allow you to make warm, healthy foods that are as great as you can create them at home in your kitchen.

Camp cooking doesn't have to be limited to sandwiches and baked potatoes wrapped in aluminum foil.  Just about any cooking system you use in the kitchen could be replicated around the campfire. For example, use a dutch oven or pit cooking to bake your food. You could also easily bake foods at a bowl over a grill, or boil, braise and beverage. What type of camping cookware is ideal for you? Camp cooking and clean-up may be easy or a hassle, it all starts with great camping gear.

Some pots/pans arrive in sets that partner together or"nest" for storage and also let you tuck a spoonful of fuel inside them. This really comes in handy once you're seeking to save room while camping.

Place your meal from the tin can and just heat the contents of your can over a fire. You will have a hot meal ready in minutes.  This technique works great for soups, beans and poultry.

A more time-consuming camp cooking technique which also produces delectable meals is pit cooking.  It is also a wonderful camp cooking method if you are using a dutch oven or cast iron cookware. Pit cooking calms your food by heating rocks and coals which are buried in the ground. As the stones cool away, their emitted heat cooks the food. To pit cookfirst dig a hole that is approximately three times larger than your cookware. Line the pit with stones and construct a fire in the middle. When the fire has burnt rapidly for approximately an hour, push the hot coals and rocks into the center. Layer your wrapped food or covered skillets in addition to the rocks and coals and put more on top. Following a couple of hours, you will have some delicious camp food to enjoy.
