##### The ingredients needed to prepare Meatball Parmesan:

1. You need 1 lb cooked meatballs; recipe below for my homemade ones
1. Get 2 cup marinara sauce, my recipe below or your favorite and more for serving
1. Use 2 cup shredded cheese, I used italian four cheese blend
1. Use 1 tsp italian seasoning spice blend
1. Provide 8 oz cooked pasta, if using, I used linquine


##### Steps to make Meatball Parmesan:

1. Combine meatballs with marinara sauce. If using pasta, put the cooked pasta on bottom of prepared pan. Top with meatballs. Cover meatballs with cheese, sprinkle with italian seasoning. -  - https://cookpad.com/us/recipes/350528-basic-tender-juicy-meatballs - https://cookpad.com/us/recipes/366612-simple-basic-marinara-sauce
1. Bake just until heated through, about 15 minutes. Serve with more sauce if desired.
1. This is good just as meatball parmesan, without the pasta. Serve with garlic bread or as an appetizer.


Toss meatball mixture through spaghetti, and serve topped with basil leaves and extra parmesan. The trick to these meatballs is to keep them small. Don&#39;t actually use a teaspoon, but use about a teaspoon&#39;s amount of mince to roll each ball. If there are children around, so much the better; they tend to like making these. But otherwise, they&#39;re easy enough, and the slow repetitiveness of the action can be rather calming.
