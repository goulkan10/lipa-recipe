<i>Before you jump to Strawberry Ice Cream Pie recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about {<strong>The Simple Ways to Be Healthy</strong>.</i>
Becoming A Healthy Eater

    
Camp cooking can be as elaborate or simple as you would like it to be. If you want to prepare fast and easy but healthy meals when you're camping, camp cooking doesn't even have to require a flame. However, if you're interested in fueling your camping excursion using a feast, camp cooking can allow you to make warm, healthy foods that are as great as you can create them at home in your kitchen.

Camp cooking doesn't need to be limited to sandwiches and baked potatoes wrapped in aluminum foil.  Almost any cooking process you are using from the kitchen can be duplicated around the home. For example, use a dutch oven or pit cooking to bake your meals. You can also easily bake foods at a bowl over a grill, or boil, braise and roast. What sort of camping cookware is best for you? Camp cooking and clean-up can be easy or a hassle, it all starts with great camping equipment.

Some pots/pans come in places that partner together or"nest" for storage and also allow you to tuck a canister of gas within them. This really comes in handy once you're seeking to save space whilst camping.

Listed below are some camping items to consider with you if you're thinking about preparing some meals around the home. These common kitchen items will allow you to duplicate tasty meals while you are out of doors.

• Salt and pepper
• Other your favourite herbs and spices
• Cooking oil
• Pot holder
• Hand-held can opener
• Aluminum foil
• Tongs and spatula
• Cutting knives
• Cutting board
• Mixing bowl


If you have only a couple of campers and are searching for some simple camp cooking, try the easy and speedy technique of tin can cooking. All you will need is a clean tin can -- a one gallon size can works well. Your source of warmth may be little campfire, or when wood burning is prohibited, a little buddy burner may work well, which may be located at sporting good stores or online. Put your meal from the tin could and easily warm the contents of your own can over a flame. You will have a hot meal ready in minutes.  This technique works great for soups, beans and poultry.

A more time-consuming pub cooking technique which also produces yummy meals is pit cooking. Pit cooking is fantastic for items that could be wrapped in aluminum foil to be cooked.  It is also a wonderful camp cooking system if you're using a dutch oven or cast iron cookware. Pit cooking calms your food by heating stones and coals that are buried in the floor. As the stones cool off, their emitted heat cooks the food. To pit cookfirst dig a hole that's approximately three times bigger than your cookware. Line the pit with rocks and construct a fire in the middle. Once the fire has burned rapidly for about an hourpush the warm coals and stones into the middle. Twist your wrapped food or covered skillets on top of the stones and coals and put on top. After a few hours, you'll have some delicious camp food to enjoy.

Sure, the ice cream is store-bought and the no-bake crust uses graham crackers, but this stunning frozen pie is anything but humble. In this healthy strawberry daiquiri-inspired ice cream pie recipe, graham crackers make an easy and tasty crust for the strawberry, rum and lime filling made with nonfat vanilla Greek yogurt. This light-as-air pie has sweetened cream cheese, fresh whipped cream, and plenty of strawberries piled high on a graham cracker crust. I can&#39;t believe it, but this is my first frozen dessert of the summer! Combine milk and ice cream in bowl.
