Getting A Healthy Eater

    
Camp cooking can be as complicated or simple as you want it to be. If you would like to prepare fast and simple but healthy meals while you're swimming, camp cooking doesn't even have to require a flame. But if you're thinking about ridding your camping excursion with a feast, camp cooking can enable you to make hot, healthy foods that are as great as you can make them at home in your own kitchen.

Camp cooking does not need to be limited to sandwiches and baked potatoes wrapped in aluminum foil.  Almost any cooking procedure you are using from the kitchen could be replicated around the home. For instance, use a dutch oven or pit cooking to bake your meals. You could also easily fry foods in a bowl over a grill, or boil, braise and beverage. Which sort of camping cookware is ideal for you? Camp cooking and clean-up may be easy or a hassle, and it all starts with great camping equipment.

Some pots/pans come in sets that partner collectively or"nest" for storage and also allow you to tuck a canister of fuel inside them. This really comes in handy when you're looking to save space while camping.

Following are some camping things to take with you if you're planning on preparing some meals around the home. These frequent kitchen items allow you to duplicate tasty meals while you're out of doors.


• Other your favorite herbs and spices
• Cooking oil
• Pot holder
• Hand-held can opener
• Aluminum foil

• Cutting knives
• Cutting board
• Mixing bowl
• Paper or plastic silverware, plates and cups

In case you have just a few campers and are looking for some easy camp cooking, try the simple and quick technique of tin could cooking. All you will need is a fresh tin can -- a 1 gallon size can works nicely. Your source of heat may be small campfire, or when wood burning is prohibited, a small buddy burner may work well, which can be found at sporting good stores or online. Put your meal from the tin can and easily heat the contents of your own can over a fire. You'll have a hot meal ready in minutes.  This technique works great for sauces, beans and poultry.

A more time-consuming camp cooking technique which also produces yummy meals is pit cooking. Pit cooking is terrific for items which may be wrapped in aluminum foil to be cooked.  It's also a great camp cooking system if you're using a dutch oven or cast iron cookware. Pit cooking warms your meals by heating stones and coals that are concealed in the floor. As the stones cool away, their emitted heat cooks the meals. To pit cook, first dig a hole that is approximately three times larger than your cookware. Line the pit with rocks and create a fire in the middle. Once the flame has burned rapidly for about an hourpush the warm coals and stone into the center. Layer your wrapped food or covered skillets in addition to the rocks and coals and place more on top. After a couple of hours, you will have some tasty camp food to relish.
