1. Put everything in a pot. Stir. Cook on high for 15 minutes. Stir occasionally.


Once the meatballs are cooked on each sides, pour the bbq sauce over them and cover them in the sauce. Place your cooked meatballs into slow cooker. Frozen meatballs don&#39;t need to be thawed, and homemade meatballs are best if you leave them a little uncooked. However, you can place fully cooked and thawed meatballs without any problems. I used a honey chipotle BBQ sauce to give the meatballs a little kick.
