I also like to put this on a soft tortilla wrap with sour cream, jalape√±os and extra cheese! helga E&#39;Ville. This Carl&#39;s Jr. copycat Santa Fe Grilled Chicken Sandwich has a teriyaki sauce marinated chicken breast that is served on a whole wheat bun, topped with chee. This Santa Fe Chicken is incredibly easy to make! It used already cooked diced chicken which is great when you have leftover chicken breasts and everything is added to pot that the noodles were boiled in. The heat from the boiled noodles helps melt the cheese and mingle the flavors and ingredients together.
