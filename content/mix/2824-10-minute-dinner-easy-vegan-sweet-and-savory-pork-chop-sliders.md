(it is a good idea to wave your hand slowly a few inches above the grill to feel for hot/cold spots) it may take awhile for the pork to be done. make sure the internal temperature reaches at least 155째f (FDA has approved 145째f if allowed to set for 3 minutes before eating)"
- "while the pork is getting cooked step back into the kitchen and prep the veggies. first cut and wash the lettuce, then onion, and apple.place your cut apple in ice cold water with a little lemon juice in an air tight container(to keep it from browning). then place all veggies back in fridge until the pork is cooked."
- "once your pork is cooked slice each chop in half to fit the slider buns. then dress each bun with strawberry jam (top and bottom) lettuce (top and bottom) place your pork down on the bun then add onion and apple. now enjoy with your favorite side. each pork chop should yield 2 sliders."
- "if you want a more even shaped slider try using ground pork and adding chopped apple to it before it&#39;s cooked.  :-) enjoy.  sorry for not posting more or being quick to answer your questions. life has been a little hectic for me lately. hope you like them. I know I sure did. oh and thank you to all who reviewed/comment on my last recipe. any and all feed back is good."

Slightly sweet with savory spices and a tangy kick, this marinade for pork chops will make the meat tender, juicy, and fill it with mouthwatering flavor. Made with apple cider vinegar, olive oil, garlic powder, ground mustard, coriander, sea salt, brown sugar and honey, the flavors of this made-from-scratch marinade covers all the bases! I love how simple this recipe is to throw together, and. In a large resealable plastic bag; combine the first four ingredients; add pork chops, a few pieces at a time, and shake to coat. Combine the sauce ingredients; pour over chops.
