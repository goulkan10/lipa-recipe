Camp cooking can be as elaborate or simple as you would like it to be. If you wish to prepare quick and simple but healthy meals while you're camping, camp cooking does not even have to require a flame. However, if you're interested in ridding your camping excursion with a feast, camp cooking can enable you to earn warm, healthy foods that are as good as you can create them at home in your kitchen.

You may also easily fry foods in a bowl over a grill, or boil, braise and roast. What kind of camping cookware is ideal for you?

When you have only a couple campers and are looking for some very easy camp cooking, try the simple and fast technique of tin can cooking. All you'll need is a fresh tin can -- a 1 gallon size can works nicely. Your source of heat can be a little campfire, or if wood burning is prohibited, a little buddy burner may work nicely, which may be found at sporting good stores or online. Put your meal from the tin can and simply heat the contents of your can over a fire.  This technique works great for soups, beans and tuna fish.

A more time-consuming pub cooking technique which also produces delectable meals is pit cooking. Pit cooking is excellent for items which may be wrapped in aluminum foil to be cooked.  It is also a excellent camp cooking system if you're using a dutch oven or cast iron cookware. Pit cooking warms your food by heating stones and coals that are concealed in the ground. As the rocks cool away, their emitted heat cooks the food. To pit cookfirst dig a hole that is approximately three times larger than your own cookware. Line the pit with rocks and build a fire in the middle. When the fire has burned rapidly for approximately an hour, push the hot coals and stones into the middle. Layer your wrapped food or covered skillets on top of the stones and coals and place more on top. After a number of hours, you will have some tasty camp food to relish.
