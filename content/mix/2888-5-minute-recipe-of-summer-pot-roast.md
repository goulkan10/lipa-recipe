Cut up potatoes, onions and celery in to fairly large chunks and place in a slow cooker along with the carrots. Put roast on top of vegetables. Place the the stock cube on top of roast and pour in water. Pot roasts typically use the tougher cuts of beef—a chuck roast or shoulder roast—which have the most flavor. Slow cooking at low heat is what melts the tough connective tissue between the muscle fibers, leaving you with tender meat that pulls apart with your fork.
