Mathris are (mostly) disc-shaped savory Indian snacks made using any kind of flour or a combination of flours and herbs. They tend to have a crispy yet flaky texture and are traditionally fried. These savory crackers/biscuits are a popular traditional tea-time snack. They are also made during Indian festivals like Holi and Diwali. Savory Snack ~ Matri Its not everyday that I find myself sitting in the verandah overlooking the garden, relishing deep-fried comforts over a cup of masala chai.
