Mouth-watering Szechuan style king oyster mushroom. We were a large group that day at lunch and the dishes kept coming. Shiitake mushrooms, oyster mushrooms, garlic, and scallions are cooked in sesame oil, sealed in dumpling wrappers, and steamed or pan-fried to perfection. These can be enjoyed two different ways: as dumplings (i.e., steamed) or as potstickers (i.e., pan-fried and then briefly steamed).
