- "34 g (5 tbsp) powdered or icing sugar"
- "1 egg yolk"
- "1/4 tsp salt"
- "  Filling"

recipeinstructions:
- "Https://youtu.be/v0Q1T6bQ_88"
- "To make the crust: In a medium bowl, place flour, sugar, salt, and butter. Rub the butter into the dry mixture with our fingers until it resembles a coarse meal. Alternatively, we can use a fork or pastry blender."
- "Add the yolk and mix until it comes together and forms a ball."
- "Transfer onto a cling wrap. Cover and chill it in the fridge for at least 30 minutes."
- "To make custard filling: In a small bowl, stir sugar with hot water until completely dissolved. Set it aside to cool."
- "In a medium pouring jar, whisk the milk, egg, and vanilla extract until thoroughly mixed. Add the sugar syrup and whisk again to combine."
- "To get a smooth custard, strain the mixture twice. First into another bowl, then back into the pouring jar."
- "Assembly: On a lightly floured surface, roll the chilled dough into a thickness of 3/4-inch (0.5 cm)."
- "Using the same size cookie cutter as the tart mold, cut as many circles as possible from the dough. I used 2Â¾-inches (7 cm) tart mold and cookie cutter."
- "Gently press each cut-out into the tart molds."
- "Prick the bottom of each tart shell with a fork for about 10 times. These holes will allow steam to release from the dough while baking and prevent it from puffing up."
- "Pour the custard filling into the tart shell. Fill each up to 75%."
- "Bake for 25 to 30 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the center of custard can stand on its own. If the custard filling cooks too quickly and bubbles up, open the oven door a little for about 10 seconds."
- "Remove tartlets from the shells once cool. Enjoy!"

Camp cooking can be as complicated or simple as you would like it to be. If you wish to prepare quick and simple but nutritious meals when you are camping, camp cooking doesn't even need to need a fire. However, if you are thinking about fueling your camping trip having a feast, then camp cooking can make it possible for you to make hot, healthy foods which are as good as you can create them at home in your kitchen.

 Almost any cooking method you are using from the kitchen can be duplicated around the home. For example, use a dutch oven or pit cooking to bake your meals. You could also easily bake foods in a bowl over a grill, or boil, braise and beverage. What type of camping cookware is ideal for you? Camp cooking and cleanup can be easy or a hassle, it all starts with great camping gear.

Some pots/pans come in sets that partner jointly or"nest" for storage and even let you tuck a canister of fuel inside them. This really comes in handy once you're looking to save space whilst camping.

Following are some camping things to carry with you if you're planning on preparing some meals around the campfire. These common kitchen items allow you to replicate yummy meals when you are out of doors.


â€¢ Other of your favourite herbs and spices
â€¢ Cooking oil
â€¢ Pot holder

â€¢ Aluminum foil

In case you have only a couple campers and are searching for some very easy camp cooking, try the simple and speedy technique of tin may cooking. All you'll need is a clean tin can -- a 1 gallon size can works nicely. Your source of heat can be a little campfire, or if wood burning is illegal, a little buddy burner will work well, which may be located at sporting good stores or online.

A more time-consuming pub cooking technique that also produces tasty food is pit cooking.  It is also a great camp cooking method if you are using a dutch oven or cast iron cookware. Pit cooking warms your meals by heating stones and coals which are buried in the ground. As the rocks cool away, their emitted heat cooks the meals. To pit cookfirst dig a hole that is approximately three times larger than your own cookware. Line the pit with stones and create a fire in the middle. When the fire has burned rapidly for approximately an hourpush the hot coals and stone into the middle. Twist your wrapped meals covered skillets in addition to the stones and coals and place on top. After a couple of hours, you'll have some delicious camp food to enjoy.
