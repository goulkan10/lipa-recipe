<i>Before you jump to Russian Potato Pancakes - Draniki recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about {<strong>The Basics of Being Healthy</strong>.</i>
Becoming A Healthy Eater

    
Camp cooking can be as complicated or simple as you would like it to be. If you would like to prepare fast and simple but nutritious meals as you are camping, camp cooking does not even need to require a fire. However, if you're considering ridding your camping trip using a feast, then camp cooking can make it possible for you to make hot, healthy foods which are as great as you can create them at home in your own kitchen.

Camp cooking doesn't need to be limited to sandwiches and baked potatoes wrapped in aluminum foil.  Just about any cooking process you use from the kitchen could be replicated around the campfire. For example, use a dutch oven or pit cooking to consume your food. You may also easily fry foods at a pan over a grill, or boil, braise and roast. What sort of camping cookware is best for you? Camp cooking and cleanup can be easy or a hassle, and it all starts with great camping equipment.

Some pots/pans arrive in places that mate together or"nest" for storage and also allow you to tuck a canister of fuel inside them. This comes in handy when you're wanting to save room whilst camping.

Following are some camping items to take with you if you are planning on preparing some meals around the campfire. These common kitchen items will allow you to duplicate tasty meals while you're out of doors.

• Salt and pepper
• Other of your favourite herbs and spices
• Cooking oil
• Pot holder

• Aluminum foil
• Tongs and spatula
• Cutting knives
• Cutting board
• Mixing bowl


If you have just a couple of campers and are searching for some easy camp cooking, try the simple and speedy technique of tin may cooking. All you'll need is a clean tin can -- a 1 gallon size can works nicely. Your source of warmth can be a little campfire, or if wood burning is prohibited, a little buddy burner may work nicely, which may be located at sporting good stores or online. Put your meal in the tin can and easily heat the contents of your own can over a flame. You will have a hot meal ready in seconds.  This technique works great for sauces, beans and tuna fish.

A more time-consuming pub cooking technique which also produces tasty food is pit cooking. Pit cooking is terrific for items that could be wrapped in aluminum foil to be cooked.  It's also a wonderful camp cooking system if you are using a dutch oven or cast iron cookware. Pit cooking calms your meals by heating stones and coals that are concealed in the ground. As the rocks cool away, their emitted heat cooks the food. To pit cookfirst dig a hole that's about three times bigger than your own cookware. Line the pit with rocks and build a fire in the middle. Once the fire has burned rapidly for approximately one hourpush the warm coals and stones into the middle. Twist your wrapped food or covered skillets in addition to the rocks and coals and put on top. After a few hours, you will have some delicious camp food to relish.

This is a variation of my Mom&#39;s classic draniki recipe. Draniki (also known as deruny), are unusual but tasty Russian stuffed potato pancakes. Draniki or potato flapjacks, are thick pancakes made from potatoes that are served hot with cold sour cream, garlic sauce or berries (cranberries are especially good). The name draniki means &#34;having been grated&#34; because the potatoes are not cut but finely grated. Method: Place a large mesh sieve over a bowl.
