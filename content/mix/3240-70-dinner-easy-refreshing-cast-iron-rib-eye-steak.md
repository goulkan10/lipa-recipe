You should also think about that by not heating the home by employing your stove top or oven you're also preventing your air conditioning (or other heating methods) from working overtime to be able to compensate for the additional heat which other cooking systems introduce.

This makes crock pot cooking a win-win situation since the costs involved with managing a crock pot are far less than the expenses related to managing a cooker or stove generally. Whether electric or gas, your cooker and oven tend to be serious energy hogs. Add to that the fact that you are not raising the temperature in your house by traditional way of cooking and you're using less energy.

Unfortunately for many, the general consensus has been that crock pots were meant for comfort foods and hearty winter meals.  The simple truth is that the crock pot should be one of the best loved and most frequently utilized cooking techniques if it is possible to handle it. In regards to cooking with a crock pot, the choices are nearly limitless.

In addition to the cost advantages mentioned above as it pertains to crock pot cooking there are a number of other advantages that are worth mentioning.

This usually means that you are not as inclined to forget an ingredient or make different errors which frequently occur as we hurriedly prepare a dinner when we are exhausted from the actions of daily.

Second, many good crock pot recipes incorporate the vegetables that insure we're getting the nutrients that we need. So frequently, when planning a meal at the last moment, vegetables and other side dishes have been left out in favor of expedience. Crock pot cooking many instances is really a meal in 1 dish.

One other fantastic reason to use a crock pot for your summertime cooking is that the ease of clean up.  Unlike pans and pans, most crock pot meals are created in 1 dish. This usually means that there is not going to be mountains of meals to be hand cleaned or loaded into the dishwasher (or if you are like me-both) later. You're able to spend less time cleaning just as you spent less time slaving over a hot cooker. Oh wait! Ensure no time slaving over a hot stove. Once clean up is complete you can get back to enjoying the sunshine set, pursuing the lightening bugs with your little ones, or even waiting for your first star.

While there'll never be a one size fits all best cooking method, crock pot cooking comes very near. When you've got a crock pot gathering dust somewhere in the back of your pantry it's time to get out it, dust if off, and dig some wonderful summer crock pot cooking recipes.
