Another great reason to use a crock pot for your summer cooking is the ease of clean up.  Unlike vegetables and pans, most crock pot meals are made in one dish. This usually means that there isn't going to be mountains of dishes to be hand cleaned or packed into the dishwasher (or in case you're like me-both) afterwards. You can spend less time cleaning only as you spent less time slaving over a hot stove. Oh wait! Make that no time slaving over a hot cooker. After clean up is complete you can get back to enjoying the sun set, pursuing the lightening bugs with your small ones, or even waiting for your very first celebrity.

While there will be no one size fits all very ideal cooking system, crock pot cooking comes very close. If you have a crock pot gathering dust somewhere at the back of your pantry it's the right time to get out it, dust if offand dig some great summer crock pot cooking recipes.
