<i>Before you jump to Black-eyed-peas glutinous rice (Lepet) recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about {<strong>Easy Ways to Get Healthy</strong>.</i>
Becoming A Healthy Eater

Whether your traveling on the go or round the
Home, you don't have to give up healthy eating
Simply because you're on the run. The Truth Is,
Healthy eating is even more significant when your
Attempting to keep up with a hectic schedule.


Worry better. As you hustle around, a healthy meal
Is most likely the very last thing you consider. The
Following ideas may help you eat if your on the move.

Restaurants
With tempting menus, large portions, and a festive
Air, it's easy to bypass healthy eating. It's
Okay to splurge every now and then, although you'll
Pack a great deal of weight if you make it a habit.
When you eat at restaurants, always be smart
about it.

Airports
An airport may be a very stressful area, although
You should not scrap your diet because of it. Eat
As you are hungry, not because of stress,
Boredom, or even to kill the time.

In your car

So that if you get hungry - you have them.

At home
Evenings and mornings are busy times in many houses.
Obtaining the time to eat could be difficult, though you
Shouldn't run out the door without eating breakfast
first. Cereal with milk, a banana, muffin, as well as 
A bagel is a terrific way to start the day.

Anytime you are on the go, always Be Sure That you
Make the ideal food decisions. 
Food with you if you will need to, so that you have it
When you require it. Eating healthy on the go is easy
To do, once you know how. Never sacrifice healthy
Food for junk, as your own system will regret it afterwards.

The food is a wonderful blend of smelling sticky rice, buttery and tender mung bean, sweet, a little salty, greasy coconut milk sauce. Use a paring knife to shell the peas and discard any tough outer skin. The addition of liquid towards the end of steaming glutinous rice to get it moist is similar to the way I made mango sticky rice. Lo Mai Gai (糯米鸡)/ Steamed Glutinous Rice with Chicken. You can eat Lepet as it is or fry the rice dumpling with a little oil.
