Camp cooking can be as elaborate or simple as you would like it to be. If you wish to prepare fast and easy but nutritious meals while you're camping, camp cooking does not even have to require a fire. However, if you're considering ridding your camping trip with a feast, camp cooking can allow you to make warm, healthy foods which are as great as you can make them at home in your own kitchen.

 Almost any cooking system you are using in the kitchen could be duplicated around the home. For example, use a toaster or pit cooking to consume your food. You can also easily fry foods at a pan over a grill, or boil, braise and roast. Which type of camping cookware is best for you? Camp cooking and cleanup can be easy or a hassle, it all starts with great camping equipment.

Some pots/pans come in sets that mate jointly or"nest" for storage and even let you tuck a canister of fuel inside them. This really comes in handy when you're trying to save room while camping.

Following are some camping things to take with you if you're planning on preparing some meals around the campfire. These frequent kitchen items will allow you to replicate yummy meals while you are out of doorways.

• Salt and pepper
• Other your favorite herbs and spices
• Cooking oil
• Pot holder
• Hand-held can opener
• Aluminum foil
• Tongs and spatula
• Cutting knives

• Mixing bowl
• Paper or plastic silverware, plates and cups

When you have just a couple of campers and are looking for some very simple camp cooking, try the simple and speedy technique of tin could cooking. All you will need is a fresh tin can -- a one gallon size may works nicely. Your source of warmth can be a little campfire, or if wood burning is prohibited, a little buddy burner will work nicely, which can be located at sporting good stores or online. Put your meal in the tin can and simply warm the contents of your can over a flame. You will have a hot meal ready in minutes.  This technique works great for sauces, beans and poultry.

A more time-consuming pub cooking technique that also produces tasty meals is pit cooking.  It is also a excellent camp cooking method if you're using a dutch oven or cast iron cookware. Pit cooking warms your meals by heating rocks and coals which are concealed in the floor. As the rocks cool off, their emitted heat cooks the meals. To pit cook, first dig a hole that's approximately three times bigger than your own cookware. Line the pit with stones and construct a fire in the center. Once the flame has burnt rapidly for about one hourpush the warm coals and rocks into the middle. Twist your wrapped food covered skillets on top of the rocks and coals and place on top. Following a few hours, you'll have some tasty camp food to relish.
