This usually means that there won't be mountains of dishes to be hand washed or packed to the dishwasher (or if you are like me-both) afterwards. You're able to spend less time cleaning just as you spent less time slaving over a hot cooker. Oh wait! Make that no time slaving over a hot cooker. Once tidy is complete you can get back to enjoying the sunshine set, chasing the lightening bugs along with your little ones, or waiting for your very first star.
