Another terrific reason to use a crock pot for your summertime cooking is the ease of clean up.  Unlike pans and pans, most crock pot foods are made in 1 dish. This means that there isn't going to be mountains of dishes to be either hand cleaned or packed to the dishwasher (or if you're like me-both) later. You can spend less time cleaning only as you spent less time slaving over a hot stove. Oh wait! Ensure time slaving over a hot stove. After clean up is complete you can get back to enjoying the sunshine set, pursuing the lightening bugs with your small ones, or even waiting for the very first star.
