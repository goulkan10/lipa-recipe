<i>Before you jump to Steamed Sweet Rice / Sticky Rice recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about {<strong>The Basics of Being Healthy</strong>.</i>
Becoming A Healthy Eater

It is possible for people to make healthy food choices even when they simply have a short period to prepare their own meals. The very first thing to realize is that it's frequently that healthy alternatives don't always signify a demand for two-hour meals. Someone could select healthy foods that are fast and easy to prepare at home or even to pick out of a takeout place. Cities often provide restaurant guides within their telephone books that display full-page menus indicating what a particular restaurant or drive-thru offers. A number of these food vendors now include healthy alternatives to their customary fast-food selection.

 This has motivated the restaurants to present other options within their hamburger choices. Hamburgers can be ordered with no bun, for instance, and fruit and yogurt are included on the menu along with fresh salads. Many restaurants offer salad choices either as unwanted orders or as complete meals. Frequently, a salad of fresh vegetables with sliced ham, roast beef or poultry is more attractive than normal menu items.  Salads are particularly appealing in the summertime because they're lighter on the digestive tract.

Restaurants that contain foods in year cultivated by local farmers provide very healthy and affordable options.  This provides the user with a totally new choice and promotes them to go to the restaurant again.

If home preparation of meals is preferred, the choices for healthy decisions grow. Seeing a local grocery store or supermarket highlights the amount of healthy choices which are available.  All types of cuisine may be prepared quickly due to the choices of new goods instead of frozen foods. There are many options of frozen foods too. The demand for healthy frozen dinners and other meals has increased alongside demands for much more variety in food that is frozen supplies. Any frozen food aisle in almost any supermarket will reveal as many healthy food options and bad choices. The choice is all left up to the person.

People may either opt to eat a healthy diet or an unhealthy one. Time and access to healthy choices are no longer problems for a person who is trying to eat healthy and healthier foods.

To cook &#34;xoi&#34;, Vietnamese often soak the glutinous rice for around four hours until the grains have absorbed enough water.
