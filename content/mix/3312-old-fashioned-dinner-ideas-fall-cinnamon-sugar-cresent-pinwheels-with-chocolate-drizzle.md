This means that there won't be mountains of dishes to be hand washed or packed to the dishwasher (or in case you are like me-both) later. It is possible to spend less time cleaning only as you spent less time slaving over a hot stove. Oh wait! Make that no time slaving over a hot stove. After tidy is complete you can contact enjoying the sun set, chasing the lightening bugs with your little ones, or waiting for your very first star.
