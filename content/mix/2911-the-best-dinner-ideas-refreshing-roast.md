1. Get 3 cans sliced carrots
1. Use 1/2 pkg Au-jus
1. Use 1 C McCormick brown gravy mix (4 pkgs)

Generally roast beef is cooked at a high temperature to caramelise the outside, then the temperature is turned down. This method can also be reversed with a lower temperature to start before a blast of heat at the end. As an example, see our herb-scented slow-roasted recipe. Break the garlic bulb into cloves, leaving them unpeeled. Pile all the veg, garlic and herbs into the middle of a large roasting tray and drizzle with oil.
