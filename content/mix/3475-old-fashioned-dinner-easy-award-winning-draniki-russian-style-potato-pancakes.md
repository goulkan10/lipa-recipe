When the weather warms up, the kitchen may be a terrible place to be. There are a number of things that you can do however, in regards to cooking a great homemade meal which doesn't need traditional stove top or oven cooking.

Here is the first and maybe the best reason to use the crock pot in summer time meal planning. You should also look at the fact that by not heating the house by utilizing your stove or oven you are also preventing your air conditioning (or additional cooling systems ) from working overtime to be able to compensate for the additional heat that other cooking methods introduce.

This leaves crock pot cooking a win-win scenario since the expenses involved in managing a crock pot are much less compared to the expenses related to operating a cooker or stove generally. Whether gas or electric, your cooker and oven are often significant energy hogs. Add to this the fact that you're not raising the warmth in your house by conventional means of cooking and you're using less power.

Unfortunately for many, the general consensus was the crock pots were intended for comfort foods and hearty winter foods.  The truth is that the crock pot ought to be one of your most loved and most frequently utilized cooking methods in the event you're able to handle it.  Virtually anything that can be boiled could be produced in the crock pot and many, many more wonderful and enticing foods and snacks too.

Advantages of Crock Pot Cooking

Besides the cost advantages mentioned above as it pertains to crock pot cooking there are a number of other benefits that are well worth mentioning. First of all, the majority of the work involved with crock pot cooking takes place early in the day when you're refreshed instead of at the conclusion of a hectic work or perform day. This usually means that you are not as likely to forget a component or make other errors which frequently happen as we prepare a dinner when we are tired from the actions of daily.

Secondly, many good crock pot recipes include the vegetables that guarantee we're getting the nutrients that we need. So frequently, when planning a meal at the last minute, vegetables and other side dishes are left out in favour of expedience. Crock pot cooking in many cases is really a meal in 1 dish.

Another great reason to use a crock pot for the summertime cooking is the ease of clean up.  Unlike pans and pans, most crock pot meals are created in 1 dish. This usually means that there won't be mountains of meals to be hand cleaned or packed to the dishwasher (or if you are like me-both) afterwards. You're able to spend less time cleaning only as you spent less time slaving over a hot stove. Oh wait! Make that time slaving over a hot cooker. Once clean up is complete you can get back to enjoying the sunshine set, pursuing the lightening bugs along with your small ones, or even waiting for your very first star.

While there'll never be a 1 size fits all ideal cooking process, crock pot cooking comes very close. When you've got a crock pot gathering dust somewhere in the back of your pantry it is time to get out it, dust offand dig some terrific summer crock pot cooking recipes.
