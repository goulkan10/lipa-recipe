Tteokbokki, also spelled dukbokki, topokki, or ddeokbokki, are Korean hot and spicy rice cakes. Cylindrical, chewy white rice cake noodles called tteok are stir fried in a delicious spicy gochujang based sauce. Savory elements are added to the sauce by way of anchovy stock, dried kelp and a splash of sesame oil. At its basics, the meaning of tteokbokki is derived from its name tteok which means rice cake in Hangul, and bokki means to stir-fry. So tteokbokki is stir-fried rice cake with additional ingredients and spicy sauces.
