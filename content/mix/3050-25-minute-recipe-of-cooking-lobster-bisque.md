Another excellent reason to use a crock pot for the summertime cooking is the ease of clean up.  Unlike pans and pans, most crock pot foods are made in one dish. This means that there will not be mountains of meals to be hand washed or packed into the dishwasher (or if you are like me-both) later. It's possible to spend less time cleaning just as you spent time slaving over a hot cooker. Oh wait! Ensure no time slaving over a hot stove. Once tidy is complete you can contact enjoying the sunshine set, chasing the lightening bugs along with your small ones, or even waiting for your first star.
