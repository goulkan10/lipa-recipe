This makes crock pot cooking a win-win scenario since the expenses involved in operating a crock marijuana are far less than the expenses related to managing a stove or oven in general. Whether electric or gas, your cooker and oven tend to be serious energy hogs. Add to the fact that you're not raising the temperature in your house by conventional way of cooking and you are using less energy.

 Unlike vegetables and pans, most crock pot dishes are created in one dish. This usually means that there is not going to be mountains of dishes to be hand washed or packed to the dishwasher (or in case you're like me-both) afterwards. It's possible to spend less time cleaning as you spent less time slaving over a hot stove. Oh wait! Make that no time slaving over a hot cooker. After clean up is complete you can get back to enjoying the sun set, pursuing the lightening bugs with your small ones, or waiting for the first star.

While there'll never be a one size fits all ideal cooking method, crock pot cooking comes very near. If you have a crock pot gathering dust somewhere in the rear of your pantry it's the right time to get out it, dust off, and dig up some wonderful summertime crock pot cooking recipes.
