Becoming A Healthy Eater

    
Camp cooking can be as elaborate or simple as you want it to be. If you wish to prepare fast and simple but nutritious meals as you are camping, camp cooking does not even have to require a fire. But if you are considering fueling your camping excursion having a feast, camp cooking can allow you to make warm, healthy foods which are as great as you can make them at home in your kitchen.

Camp cooking does not need to be limited to sandwiches and baked potatoes wrapped in aluminum foil.  Almost any cooking method you are using from the kitchen could be replicated around the campfire. For instance, use a toaster or pit cooking to bake your meals. You may also easily bake foods in a bowl over a grill, or boil, braise and beverage. What sort of camping cookware is ideal for you? Camp cooking and clean-up can be easy or a hassle, but it all starts with great camping gear.

Some pots/pans arrive in places that partner together or"nest" for storage and even allow you to tuck a canister of fuel inside them. This really also comes in handy when you're trying to save space while camping.

Listed below are some camping items to consider with you if you are considering preparing some meals around the campfire. These common kitchen items allow you to duplicate tasty meals as you are out of doors.

• Salt and pepper
• Other your favorite herbs and spices
• Cooking oil
• Pot holder
• Hand-held can opener
• Aluminum foil
• Tongs and spatula
• Cutting knives
• Cutting board
• Mixing bowl


If you have just a couple campers and are looking for some simple camp cooking, try the simple and fast technique of tin may cooking. All you'll need is a fresh tin can -- a 1 gallon size may works well. Your source of heat may be small campfire, or if wood burning is prohibited, a small buddy burner may work nicely, which may be found at sporting good stores or online. Put your meal in the tin could and just warm the contents of your own can over a fire. You'll have a hot meal ready in minutes.  This technique works great for sauces, beans and tuna fish.

A more time-consuming camp cooking technique which also produces delectable meals is pit cooking.  It's also a excellent camp cooking system if you are using a dutch oven or cast iron cookware. Pit cooking calms your meals by heating stones and coals which are concealed in the floor. As the rocks cool , their emitted heat cooks the food. To pit cook, first dig a hole that is roughly three times bigger than your cookware. Line the pit with stones and create a fire in the center. Once the fire has burned rapidly for about an hour, push the warm coals and stone into the middle. Twist your wrapped food covered skillets in addition to the rocks and coals and place more on top. Following a number of hours, you'll have some tasty camp food to relish.
