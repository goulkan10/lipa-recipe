Ham and Cheese Pinwheels. posted by Christy Denney I made these Ham and Cheese Pinwheels because what kid doesn&#39;t love ham and cheese. These pinwheels are the perfect solution. Using just five ingredients including buttery crescent dough, sliced ham and Swiss cheese, every roll-up is topped with a sweet drizzle of honey just before Ham &amp; Cheese Crescent Bundles. This hearty mini Danish is fluffy in the middle and crispy on the outside.
