Here is the first and possibly the very best reason to use the crock pot on summer time meal planning. You should also look at the fact that by not heating your home by using your stove top or oven you are also avoiding your air conditioning (or other cooling systems ) from working overtime in order to compensate for the extra heat that other cooking methods introduce.

This makes crock pot cooking a win-win situation as the expenses involved in managing a crock marijuana are far less than the expenses related to operating a cooker or stove in general. Whether gas or electric, your cooker and oven are often serious energy hogs. Add to this the fact that you are not increasing the temperature in your home by traditional means of cooking and you are using even less electricity.

Unfortunately for many, the general consensus was the crock pots were meant for comfort foods and hearty winter meals.  The simple reality is that the crock pot should be one of the most loved and most frequently utilized cooking techniques in case it's possible to manage it. In regards to cooking with a crock pot, the choices are almost limitless.  Virtually anything that can be boiled could be produced in the crock pot and many, many more lovely and enticing foods and snacks too.

Advantages of Crock Pot Cooking

In addition to the cost advantages mentioned previously as it pertains to crock pot cooking there are a number of different benefits that are worth mentioning. First of all, the bulk of the work entailed in crock pot cooking occurs early in the afternoon when you're refreshed rather than at the end of a hectic work or play day. This usually means that you're not as inclined to forget an ingredient or make other errors which frequently occur as we prepare a dinner once we are exhausted from the activities of daily.

Secondly, many great crock pot recipes include the vegetables that insure we're getting the nutrients that we need. So often, when planning a meal at the last minute, vegetables and other side dishes are made in favour of expedience. Crock pot cooking in many cases is a meal in one dish.

One other excellent reason to use a crock pot for the summertime cooking is the ease of clean up.  Unlike pots and pans, many crock pot meals are made in one dish. This usually means that there isn't going to be mountains of dishes to be hand washed or packed to the dishwasher (or in case you are like me-both) afterwards. It is possible to spend less time cleaning just as you spent time slaving over a hot cooker. Oh wait! Ensure no time slaving over a hot stove. Once clean up is complete you can contact enjoying the sunshine set, chasing the lightening bugs along with your little ones, or even waiting for your very first celebrity.

While there'll never be a one size fits all ideal cooking system, crock pot cooking comes very close. If you have a crock pot collecting dust somewhere at the rear of your pantry it's the right time to get it out, dust off, and dig up some wonderful summer crock pot cooking recipes.
