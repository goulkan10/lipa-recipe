Becoming A Healthy Eater

    
Camp cooking can be as complicated or simple as you want it to be. If you want to prepare fast and simple but healthy meals while you're swimming, camp cooking doesn't even have to need a fire. But if you are thinking about fueling your camping excursion having a feast, then camp cooking can enable you to make warm, healthy foods that are as great as you can create them at home in your kitchen.

Camp cooking doesn't need to be limited to sandwiches and baked potatoes wrapped in aluminum foil.  Just about any cooking method you are using in the kitchen can be duplicated around the home. For example, use a toaster or pit cooking to bake your food. You may also easily fry foods at a bowl over a grill, or boil, braise and roast. Which type of camping cookware is ideal for you? Camp cooking and clean-up can be easy or a hassle, but it all starts with great camping equipment.

Some pots/pans arrive in sets that mate collectively or"nest" for storage and also allow you to tuck a spoonful of gas within them. This comes in handy once you're trying to save room while camping.

Listed below are some camping items to take with you if you're considering preparing some meals around the campfire. These common kitchen items will allow you to replicate yummy meals while you are out of doors.

• Salt and pepper
• Other of your favourite herbs and spices
• Cooking oil
• Pot holder

• Aluminum foil

• Cutting knives
• Cutting board
• Mixing bowl


If you have only a few campers and are looking for some very easy camp cooking, try the easy and speedy technique of tin may cooking. All you will need is a fresh tin can -- a 1 gallon size can works nicely. Your source of warmth may be little campfire, or if wood burning is illegal, a small buddy burner will work well, which may be located at sporting good stores or online. Put your meal from the tin can and easily warm the contents of your can over a flame. You'll have a hot meal ready in seconds.  This technique works great for soups, beans and poultry.

A more time-consuming camp cooking technique which also produces tasty meals is pit cooking.  It is also a wonderful camp cooking system if you are using a dutch oven or cast iron cookware. Pit cooking calms your meals by heating stones and coals that are concealed in the ground. As the stones cool , their emitted heat cooks the food. To pit cookfirst dig a hole that is approximately three times bigger than your own cookware. Line the pit with stones and build a fire in the center. When the fire has burnt rapidly for approximately one hour, push the warm coals and rocks into the center. Twist your wrapped meals or covered skillets in addition to the rocks and coals and place on top. After a few hours, you'll have some tasty camp food to enjoy.
