Here&#39;s an idea of what you get when you take a bite if you&#39;ve never had a glaze on a pork chop. Keep in mind, this is my daughter taking her first bites of it. Sarah taking her first bite - &#34;This is weird.&#34; Then taking her second bite - &#34;But, it&#39;s not bad.&#34; She. wow I love this recipe however I add Stove Top Pork stuffin mix to it I prepared it as the box says and then spreaded it on top of the pork chops and the that all ready had the sauce on them and I also used quick fry thin pork chops and they came out really great. Reducing blueberry puree and balsamic vinegar together creates a sweet-tart glaze that is perfect for pork chops. Serve these pork chops with grilled vegetables (I&#39;m a fan of grilled squash and green beans), potatoes and/or garlic bread.
