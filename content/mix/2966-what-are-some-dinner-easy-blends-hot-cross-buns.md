recipeingredient:
- " For the ferment"
- "20 g (1 1/2 tbsp.) sugar"
- "10 g fresh or 1  tsp fast action yeast"
- "280 g (1 1/4 cup) warm milk"
- "140 g (1 cup) wholemeal flour"
- " For the dough"
- "310 g (2 1/2 cup) strong white flour"
- "7 g (2 tsp) mixed spice"
- "3 g (1 tsp) cinnamon"
- "50 g (3 1/2 tbsp.) butter softened"
- "35 g (2 tbsp.) sugar"
- "1 medium egg 50g"
- "5 g (3/4 tsp) salt"
- "180 g (6 oz.) sultanas"
- "80 g (3 oz.) raisins"
- "40 g (3 tbsp.) white rum or fruit juice or water"
- " For the crossing mix"
- "50 g (4 tbsp.) plain flour"
- "1 g (1/2 tsp) baking powder"
- "5 g (1 tsp) vegetable oil"
- "50 g (1/4 cup) water"
- " For the glaze"
- "50 g (1/4 cup) honey"
- "25 g (3 tbsp.) double cream"
recipeinstructions:
- "Prepare the raisins well in advance, best to leave them to soak for a few hours or even overnight. Put the raisins and sultanas in a ziplock bag, warm the rum or juice (on the hob or in a microwave) until almost boiling and pour over the fruit. Squash it around in the bag so that the fruit is well covered in the liquid, zip up the bag and leave for the moisture to be absorbed."
- "Prepare the ferment by dissolving the yeast in the warm milk and mixing it well with the flour and sugar. Leave to rise and bubble up for about an hour."
- "Add the dough ingredients to the ferment and knead or mix in a standing mixer with the dough hook attachment until the dough is smooth, elastic and bounces of the sides of the bowl or stops sticking to your hands. Let it rest for 10 minutes."
- "Drain the fruit – there will be next to none liquid left - and then knead it in very gently, taking care not to break up the raisins. If using the standing mixer, mix the fruit in on the lowest speed and finish off by kneading it in with your hands. The huge amount of fruit makes for delicious buns but it’s difficult to distribute it evenly – so invariably you’ll end up with some buns more fruited than others."
- "Leave the dough to prove in a warm place until doubled in size – at least an hour."
- "Turn it out onto lightly floured surface, trying not to de-gas it too much."
- "Divide the dough into 16 even pieces (they will weigh about 75g each if you want to be that precise), mold the pieces into tight balls and place on baking trays lined with parchment, spaced about 5cm apart."
- "Place the trays in large plastic bags, inflate each by blowing into it and quickly tying the ends and leave to rise for about an hour, until the buns are almost touching each other."
- "Preheat the oven to 180C/350F/gas 4."
- "Make the crossing mix – beat all the ingredients together in a bowl with a spoon. Transfer it into a piping bag (if you haven’t got one, spoon the mix into a plastic bag and cut off a corner) and pipe crosses on the buns, using your finger to stop the flow of the mix after each line."
- "Immediately put the trays in the oven and bake for 15-18 minutes until well browned – except for the crosses."
- "Transfer to a wire rack on the parchment – it will make glazing them easier if they are still slightly stuck to the parchment and not dancing around while you brush the glaze on."
- "Heat up the honey until almost starting to boil and stir in the double cream. Brush the glaze on the buns – still warm or slightly cooled down, it doesn’t matter – and leave to cool completely or be snatched to tuck into while still warm."

<i>Before you jump to Hot cross buns recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about {<strong>The Basics of Being Healthy</strong>.</i>
Getting A Healthy Eater

    
Camp cooking can be as complicated or simple as you would like it to be. If you wish to prepare fast and simple but healthy meals when you are camping, camp cooking does not even have to require a fire. But if you're considering fueling your camping trip with a feast, then camp cooking can enable you to make warm, healthy foods which are as good as you can make them at home in your own kitchen.

 Almost any cooking procedure you use in the kitchen could be replicated around the home. For example, use a dutch oven or pit cooking to consume your food. You can also easily bake foods at a pan over a grill, or boil, braise and beverage. Which kind of camping cookware is ideal for you? Camp cooking and cleanup may be easy or a hassle, it all starts with great camping gear.

Some pots/pans come in sets that partner jointly or"nest" for storage and also let you tuck a canister of gas within them. This comes in handy when you're trying to save space whilst camping.

Following are some camping things to consider with you if you're considering preparing some meals around the campfire. These frequent kitchen items allow you to duplicate tasty meals as you are out of doors.

• Salt and pepper
• Other of your favourite herbs and spices
• Cooking oil
• Pot holder
• Hand-held can opener
• Aluminum foil

• Cutting knives
• Cutting board
• Mixing bowl
• Paper or plastic silverware, plates and cups

If you have only a few campers and are searching for some easy camp cooking, try out the simple and speedy technique of tin may cooking. All you will need is a clean tin can -- a one gallon size may works well. Your source of warmth may be small campfire, or when wood burning is prohibited, a small buddy burner may work nicely, which can be seen at sporting good stores or online. Place your meal from the tin could and simply warm the contents of your own can over a flame. You'll have a hot meal ready in minutes.  This technique works great for soups, beans and poultry.

A more time-consuming camp cooking technique that also produces delectable meals is pit cooking. Pit cooking is fantastic for items which can be wrapped in aluminum foil to be cooked.  It is also a great camp cooking system if you're using a dutch oven or cast iron cookware. Pit cooking calms your food by heating stones and coals which are concealed in the floor. As the rocks cool , their emitted heat cooks the meals. To pit cook, first dig a hole that is roughly three times larger than your cookware. Line the pit with rocks and build a fire in the center. Once the fire has burnt rapidly for approximately an hourpush the hot coals and rocks into the center. Twist your wrapped meals covered skillets on top of the stones and coals and place more on top. After a few hours, you will have some tasty camp food to relish.
