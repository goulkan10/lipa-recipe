Peanut butter: Because these cookies are keto, you will need to use sugar-free peanut butter. Be sure to read the label as most peanut butters have hidden sugars. These vegan peanut butter cookies are the best cookies ever! Wonderfully crunchy and packed with peanut butter flavor. If you love peanut butter as much as I do, then you want to put it in as many things as possible, and baking it into cookies is nothing but a very fine idea.
