This usually means that there won't be mountains of meals to be hand washed or loaded into the dishwasher (or if you are like me-both) later. It is possible to spend less time cleaning just as you spent less time slaving over a hot cooker. Oh wait! Ensure no time slaving over a hot stove. After clean up is complete you can contact enjoying the sunshine set, pursuing the lightening bugs along with your little ones, or even waiting for the very first star.
