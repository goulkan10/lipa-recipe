Becoming A Healthy Eater

    
Camp cooking can be as elaborate or simple as you want it to be. If you want to prepare quick and simple but nutritious meals when you're swimming, camp cooking does not even have to require a flame. But if you are thinking about fueling your camping trip having a feast, camp cooking can make it possible for you to make hot, healthy foods that are as great as you can create them at home in your own kitchen.

Camp cooking does not have to be limited to sandwiches and baked potatoes wrapped in aluminum foil.  Almost any cooking system you use from the kitchen can be duplicated around the home. For example, use a dutch oven or pit cooking to bake your meals. You might also easily bake foods in a pan over a grill, or boil, braise and beverage. What sort of camping cookware is best for you? Camp cooking and cleanup can be easy or a hassle, it all starts with great camping equipment.

Some pots/pans come in places that mate together or"nest" for storage and also let you tuck a canister of gas within them. This comes in handy once you're searching to save space whilst camping.

Following are some camping things to carry with you if you are considering preparing some meals around the campfire. These common kitchen items will allow you to replicate yummy meals when you're out of doors.


• Other your favorite herbs and spices
• Cooking oil
• Pot holder

• Aluminum foil

• Cutting knives
• Cutting board
• Mixing bowl
• Paper or plastic silverware, plates and cups

In case you have just a few campers and are looking for some very simple camp cooking, try the simple and fast technique of tin could cooking. All you'll need is a clean tin can -- a 1 gallon size may works well. Your source of warmth can be a little campfire, or if wood burning is illegal, a little buddy burner may work nicely, which may be located at sporting good stores or online. Place your meal in the tin can and just warm the contents of your can over a flame.  This technique works great for soups, beans and tuna fish.

A more time-consuming camp cooking technique that also produces delectable meals is pit cooking.  It is also a great camp cooking system if you are using a dutch oven or cast iron cookware. Pit cooking warms your food by heating rocks and coals which are buried in the ground. As the stones cool , their emitted heat cooks the food. To pit cookfirst dig a hole that is approximately three times bigger than your own cookware. Line the pit with stones and construct a fire in the middle. Once the fire has burned rapidly for approximately an hour, push the warm coals and stone into the middle. Twist your wrapped food or covered skillets in addition to the rocks and coals and put more on top. Following a couple of hours, you'll have some delicious camp food to relish.
