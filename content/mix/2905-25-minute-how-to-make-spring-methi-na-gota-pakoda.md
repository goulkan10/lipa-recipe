Getting A Healthy Eater

    
Camp cooking can be as complicated or simple as you want it to be. If you wish to prepare quick and simple but nutritious meals while you are camping, camp cooking doesn't even have to require a fire. However, if you're interested in ridding your camping trip with a feast, camp cooking can allow you to make hot, healthy foods which are as good as you can make them at home in your kitchen.

Camp cooking does not have to be limited to sandwiches and baked potatoes wrapped in aluminum foil.  Just about any cooking system you are using in the kitchen can be duplicated around the home. For instance, use a dutch oven or pit cooking to consume your food. You can also easily fry foods at a bowl over a grill, or boil, braise and beverage. What kind of camping cookware is best for you? Camp cooking and clean-up may be easy or a hassle, it all starts with great camping gear.

Some pots/pans come in places that mate together or"nest" for storage and even let you tuck a canister of gas within them. This also comes in handy when you're wanting to save room whilst camping.

Following are some camping items to carry with you if you're thinking about preparing some meals around the home. These common kitchen items allow you to replicate yummy meals while you are out of doorways.


• Other of your favourite herbs and spices
• Cooking oil
• Pot holder

• Aluminum foil
• Tongs and spatula
• Cutting knives
• Cutting board
• Mixing bowl


In case you have only a few campers and are looking for some very easy camp cooking, try out the easy and quick technique of tin could cooking. All you will need is a clean tin can -- a one gallon size can works nicely. Your source of heat can be a little campfire, or when wood burning is illegal, a little buddy burner will work nicely, which can be found at sporting good stores or online. Place your meal from the tin can and simply warm the contents of your can over a fire. You will have a hot meal ready in seconds.  This technique works great for soups, beans and poultry.

A more time-consuming camp cooking technique which also produces yummy food is pit cooking. Pit cooking is very good for items that may be wrapped in aluminum foil to be cooked.  It is also a wonderful camp cooking method if you are using a dutch oven or cast iron cookware. Pit cooking calms your meals by heating rocks and coals which are concealed in the floor. As the rocks cool , their emitted heat cooks the food. To pit cook, first dig a hole that is approximately three times bigger than your cookware. Line the pit with stones and build a fire in the center. When the fire has burnt rapidly for about an hour, push the warm coals and rocks into the middle. Twist your wrapped meals or covered skillets in addition to the stones and coals and place more on top. Following a few hours, you will have some tasty camp food to enjoy.
