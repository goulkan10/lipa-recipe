#MangoTango recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about {<strong>The Simple Ways to Be Healthy</strong>.</i>
Getting A Healthy Eater

    
Camp cooking can be as elaborate or simple as you want it to be. If you wish to prepare fast and simple but healthy meals while you're swimming, camp cooking does not even have to need a flame. However, if you are interested in ridding your camping trip using a feast, camp cooking can allow you to make hot, healthy foods which are as great as you can create them at home in your kitchen.

Camp cooking doesn't need to be limited to sandwiches and baked potatoes wrapped in aluminum foil.  Almost any cooking process you use in the kitchen could be duplicated around the campfire. For example, use a dutch oven or pit cooking to bake your meals. You could also easily fry foods at a bowl over a grill, or boil, braise and roast. Which kind of camping cookware is best for you? Camp cooking and clean-up can be easy or a hassle, but it all starts with great camping gear.

Some pots/pans arrive in sets that mate jointly or"nest" for storage and even let you tuck a canister of fuel inside them. This also comes in handy when you're trying to save room whilst camping.

Following are some camping things to consider with you if you are planning on preparing some meals around the campfire. These common kitchen items will allow you to replicate yummy meals when you're out of doors.


• Other of your favourite herbs and spices
• Cooking oil
• Pot holder
• Hand-held can opener
• Aluminum foil
• Tongs and spatula
• Cutting knives
• Cutting board
• Mixing bowl
• Paper or plastic silverware, plates and cups

When you have only a couple campers and are searching for some easy camp cooking, try out the simple and quick technique of tin could cooking. All you will need is a clean tin can -- a 1 gallon size may works nicely. Your source of warmth can be a little campfire, or if wood burning is prohibited, a small buddy burner will work well, which can be located at sporting good stores or online. Place your meal in the tin could and easily heat the contents of your own can over a flame.  This technique works great for sauces, beans and poultry.

A more time-consuming camp cooking technique that also produces yummy food is pit cooking.  It's also a great camp cooking system if you are using a dutch oven or cast iron cookware. Pit cooking warms your food by heating rocks and coals that are concealed in the ground. As the stones cool away, their emitted heat cooks the food. To pit cook, first dig a hole that's approximately three times larger than your cookware. Line the pit with rocks and construct a fire in the center. When the fire has burned rapidly for about an hour, push the warm coals and rocks into the middle. Twist your wrapped food or covered skillets in addition to the stones and coals and put on top. After a few hours, you will have some tasty camp food to relish.
