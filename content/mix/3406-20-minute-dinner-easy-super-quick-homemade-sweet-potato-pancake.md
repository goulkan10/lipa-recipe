<i>Before you jump to Sweet Potato Pancake recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about {<strong>The Simple Ways to Be Healthy</strong>.</i>
Becoming A Healthy Eater

    
Camp cooking can be as complicated or simple as you want it to be. If you want to prepare quick and easy but healthy meals while you're swimming, camp cooking does not even have to require a flame. However, if you're considering fueling your camping excursion having a feast, then camp cooking can make it possible for you to make hot, healthy foods which are as great as you can create them at home in your own kitchen.

Camp cooking does not have to be limited to sandwiches and baked potatoes wrapped in aluminum foil.  Almost any cooking process you use from the kitchen could be duplicated around the campfire. For example, use a dutch oven or pit cooking to bake your meals. You might also easily fry foods in a bowl over a grill, or boil, braise and beverage. What kind of camping cookware is best for you? Camp cooking and clean-up may be easy or a hassle, but it all starts with great camping equipment.

Some pots/pans arrive in sets that partner together or"nest" for storage and also allow you to tuck a canister of fuel inside them. This really also comes in handy once you're wanting to save space while camping.

Listed below are some camping items to carry with you if you are planning on preparing some meals around the home. These common kitchen items allow you to duplicate tasty meals while you're out of doorways.

• Salt and pepper
• Other of your favorite herbs and spices
• Cooking oil
• Pot holder
• Hand-held can opener
• Aluminum foil

• Cutting knives
• Cutting board
• Mixing bowl
• Paper or plastic silverware, plates and cups

In case you have only a few campers and are looking for some very simple camp cooking, try out the simple and quick technique of tin can cooking. All you'll need is a clean tin can -- a 1 gallon size can works well. Your source of heat can be a small campfire, or if wood burning is prohibited, a small buddy burner may work nicely, which may be found at sporting good stores or online. Put your meal from the tin could and just heat the contents of your own can over a flame. You'll have a hot meal ready in seconds.  This technique works great for sauces, beans and tuna fish.

A more time-consuming pub cooking technique that also produces delectable meals is pit cooking.  It is also a wonderful camp cooking method if you are using a dutch oven or cast iron cookware. Pit cooking warms your food by heating rocks and coals which are concealed in the ground. As the rocks cool away, their emitted heat cooks the food. To pit cook, first dig a hole that is roughly three times bigger than your own cookware. Line the pit with stones and construct a fire in the center. When the fire has burned rapidly for about one hourpush the hot coals and stone into the middle. Layer your wrapped meals covered skillets on top of the stones and coals and put more on top. After a number of hours, you will have some tasty camp food to enjoy.

I have been making sweet potato pancakes ever since my youngest started solids. Sweet potato pancakes have been calling my name and I just couldn&#39;t resist. I eat a sweet potato nearly everyday and enjoy sprinkling them with cinnamon, peanut butter maple syrup. Our sweet potato pancakes are made with mashed sweet potatoes and a touch of spice. Top the pancakes with flavored butter or syrup.
