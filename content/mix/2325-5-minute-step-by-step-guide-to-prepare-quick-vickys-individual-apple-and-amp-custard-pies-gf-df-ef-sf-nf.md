- "With the leftover pastry, cut out small shapes for the lids such as hearts or stars, 2 or 3 for each lid depending on size. I do this to save time re-rolling the pastry. You can of course re-roll it and cut out 1 larger shape to fit as a lid"

- "If you&#39;ve pre-baked the lids you can skip the rest of the oven steps. Just fill the pies and place the baked lids on top. The custard and apple puree are already cooked anyway, the oven is just to heat them through"
- "Place the pastry shapes on top to make the lids - you don&#39;t need to glaze the pastry lids but if you like, you can. Add an extra sprinkle of sugar and cinnamon on top if you like"
- "Bake for 15 minutes or until the lids are golden"
- "Carefully remove the pies from the tin and serve warm, or let cool on a wire rack for later, dusted with icing sugar"
