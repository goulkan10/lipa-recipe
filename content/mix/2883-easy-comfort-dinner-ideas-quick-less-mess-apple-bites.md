Getting A Healthy Eater

    
Camp cooking can be as complicated or simple as you want it to be. If you want to prepare fast and easy but nutritious meals when you're camping, camp cooking doesn't even need to require a fire. But if you are interested in fueling your camping excursion having a feast, camp cooking can allow you to earn warm, healthy foods which are as great as you can make them at home in your own kitchen.

 Just about any cooking system you use from the kitchen could be replicated around the campfire. For instance, use a dutch oven or pit cooking to bake your food. You might also easily fry foods at a pan over a grill, or boil, braise and roast. Which kind of camping cookware is best for you? Camp cooking and cleanup can be easy or a hassle, but it all starts with great camping gear.

Some pots/pans come in places that mate collectively or"nest" for storage and also let you tuck a spoonful of fuel inside them. This comes in handy once you're trying to save space while camping.

Listed below are some camping things to carry with you if you're thinking about preparing some meals around the home. These frequent kitchen items will allow you to duplicate tasty meals while you're out of doorways.

• Salt and pepper
• Other of your favorite herbs and spices
• Cooking oil
• Pot holder

• Aluminum foil

• Cutting knives
• Cutting board
• Mixing bowl


If you have just a few campers and are searching for some easy camp cooking, try the easy and quick technique of tin may cooking. All you will need is a clean tin can -- a one gallon size can works well. Your source of warmth can be a small campfire, or if wood burning is illegal, a little buddy burner will work well, which can be located at sporting good stores or online. Put your meal from the tin can and simply warm the contents of your own can over a fire. You'll have a hot meal ready in seconds.  This technique works great for sauces, beans and poultry.

A more time-consuming camp cooking technique which also produces tasty meals is pit cooking.  It's also a wonderful camp cooking method if you are using a dutch oven or cast iron cookware. Pit cooking warms your food by heating rocks and coals which are buried in the ground. As the rocks cool off, their emitted heat cooks the food. To pit cookfirst dig a hole that's about three times bigger than your own cookware. Line the pit with rocks and construct a fire in the center. When the flame has burned rapidly for about one hourpush the hot coals and stones into the middle. Twist your wrapped meals or covered skillets in addition to the rocks and coals and put on top. After a couple of hours, you'll have some tasty camp food to enjoy.
