 Unlike pots and pans, many crock pot foods are made in 1 dish. This usually means that there won't be mountains of dishes to be either hand cleaned or packed into the dishwasher (or if you're like me-both) afterwards. You can spend less time cleaning as you spent less time slaving over a hot stove. Oh wait! Make that no time slaving over a hot stove. Once tidy is complete you can get back to enjoying the sunshine set, pursuing the lightening bugs along with your small ones, or waiting for the first star.

While there'll be no 1 size fits all ideal cooking procedure, crock pot cooking comes very near. When you have a crock pot collecting dust somewhere in the back of your pantry it is the right time to get it out, dust if off, and dig up some excellent summer crock pot cooking recipes.
