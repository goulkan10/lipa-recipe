Zebra Cake is as stunning as it is delicious - not overly sweet, moist, and just flavorful with a hint of cocoa and vanilla! We form the stripes by alternating light and dark batters as we assemble the cake in the pan. This cake also bakes up light and tender, ready to accept your favorite icing, and is the perfect size for a small gathering or after school snacking. This cake makes an excellent snack cake with just a dusting of confectioners&#39; sugar, or even plain. It&#39;s hard to resist those fun stripes!
