Camp cooking does not have to be limited to sandwiches and baked potatoes wrapped in aluminum foil.  Just about any cooking method you are using in the kitchen can be replicated around the campfire. For example, use a toaster or pit cooking to bake your meals. You could also easily bake foods at a bowl over a grill, or boil, braise and beverage. Which type of camping cookware is ideal for you?
