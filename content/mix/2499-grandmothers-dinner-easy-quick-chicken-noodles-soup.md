Add chopped carrots and celery to the stock and bring to a simmer. Then add chopped chicken breast or thighs and bring to a simmer again. Yes there&#39;s more steps than quick and easy chicken noodle soup recipes, but it is so worth it because this broth is something money can&#39;t buy! For the easiest chicken noodle soup, if you have a rotisserie or leftover chicken, instead of adding chicken thighs to the pot, add two to three cups of shredded or diced cooked chicken to the soup at the same time as adding the dried noodles. Place the water, stock, star-anise, cinnamon, ginger, garlic, chilli and oyster sauce in a large saucepan over medium heat.
