recipeingredient:
- "1 serving cooked white rice to fill 12 the bento box"
- "1 sheet Nori seaweed for onigiri"
- "1 slice cheese"
- " Precut shredded nori seaweed"
- "1 Edamame"
- "2 to 3 Meatballs"
recipeinstructions:
- "Pack half the bento box with rice. If the box has a divider, use it. Keep the rice covered with plastic wrap while you work to prevent it from drying out. Put the meatballs in too."
- "Cut the nori seaweed about 1cm bigger than the rice all around. The reason why it should be cut so large is because the nori shrinks a lot."
- "Cut the top part into an arch shape."
- "Take the plastic wrap off and cover the rice with the cut nori sheet. It should shrink before your eyes. Cover with the plastic wrap again. If you&#39;re not going to finish the bento right away, put it in the refrigerator."
- "Make the parts. Cut 2 pieces out of the sliced cheese using the Kyarappa cutter as shown."
- "If you slice off the end and put them together, it will become Totoro&#39;s mouth. Make it very wide."
- "Cut out Totoro&#39;s eyes using the Kyarappa cutter as shown in the photo. Cut the two circles apart where they are connected."
- "Cut out two small circles to make the Soot Sprites&#39; eyes."
- "Take the bento out of the refrigerator, and put the cut out parts on top. Tip: Place the eyes wide apart. Make the face long sideways! Don&#39;t use a long thin bento box."
- "Punch out two sets of face parts using a nori punch. Use the eyebrow parts on Totoro&#39;s chest, and the cheek parts as the Soot Sprite&#39;s eyes. Use tweezers to place the parts."
- "Here is how it looks with the nori parts in place. I used a regular paper punch from an office supply store for Totoro&#39;s eyes. I washed it well and use it for kitchen use only."
- "Use pre-cut fine shredded nori seaweed to portray the teeth. Don&#39;t worry about the top and bottom ends sticking out."
- "You can just cut off the ends later like this."
- "Stick on 5 strips for the teeth, then add the ears and nose. To make the nose, cut an edamame in half and stick it on with mayonnaise."
- "Cut the decorative dividers into ear shaped pieces, and fold them outwards. You can use old fashioned bamboo dividers, or any type you have."
- "Finished!"

<i>Before you jump to Easy Totoro Charaben (Kids Bento) recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about {<strong>The Basics of Being Healthy</strong>.</i>
Becoming A Healthy Eater

It is possible for people to make healthy food options even though they just have a brief time in which to prepare their own meals. The very first point to understand is that it is often that healthy alternatives don't always indicate a need for meals that are grated. Someone could select healthy foods that are fast and easy to prepare in your home or to pickup from a takeout place. Cities often provide restaurant guides in their telephone books that display full-page menus suggesting what a particular restaurant or drive-thru offers. Many of these food vendors now include healthy alternatives for their typical fast-food choice.

At places like McDonald's and Hardee's, it is possible to discover consumers who are concerned about their carbohydrate consumption.  It has prompted the restaurants to offer other options within their hamburger choices. Hamburgers could be arranged without the bun, for instance, and fruit and yogurt are included on the menu together with fresh cakes. Many restaurants provide salad options either as side orders or as whole meals.  Salads are particularly appealing in the summertime as they are milder on the digestive tract.

Restaurants that contain foods in season cultivated by local farmers offer quite healthy and affordable choices.  This provides the customer with a totally fresh choice and motivates them to visit the restaurant again.

If house preparation of meals is preferred, the options for healthy decisions improve. Seeing a neighborhood grocery store or grocery store highlights the number of healthy choices that are available.  All sorts of cuisine can be ready quickly due to the options of new goods as opposed to frozen foods. There are many options of frozen foods also. The demand for healthy frozen dishes and other foods has increased alongside demands for greater variety in frozen food offerings. Any frozen food aisle in almost any supermarket will show as numerous healthy food choices and bad choices. The choice is left up to the individual.

People may either decide to consume a healthy diet or an unhealthy one. Time and availability of healthy options are no longer problems for a person who is trying to eat healthy and healthier foods.
