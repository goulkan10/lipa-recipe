</br>

Healthy eating is now much more popular than in the past and rightfully so. There are a lot of health conditions associated with a poor diet and there is a cost to the overall economy as individuals suffer from health problems such as heart disease and hypertension. There are more and more campaigns to try to get people to follow a more healthy way of living and all the same it is also easier than ever to rely on fast, convenient food that is very bad for our health. Most people typically think that healthy diets call for a lot of work and will significantly alter how they live and eat. It is possible, however, to make a few simple changes that can start to make a good impact on our daily eating habits.

The first change you can make is to pay more attention to what you purchase when you shop for food as it is likely that you tend to pick up many of the things without thinking. For example, has it crossed your mind to check how much sugar and salt are in your favorite cereal? One heart-healthy alternative that can give you a positive start to your day is oatmeal. Mix in fruits or spices to enhance the flavor and now you have a breakfast that can become a normal part of your new healthy eating plan.

To sum up, it is not difficult to begin making healthy eating a part of your daily lifestyle.

Then peanut butter gets thrown into the mix. The result is a cookie dough that&#39;s perfectly tender, salty, and sweet! No baking required, easy to make, and the perfect. We highly recommend insist upon using a smooth peanut butter, like Skippy or Jif. Even though we choose natural peanut butter for our PB&amp;Js, for this recipe, the natural stuff is too runny and inconsistent.
