 Unlike pots and pans, many crock pot meals are created in one dish. This usually means that there will not be mountains of dishes to be hand cleaned or packed into the dishwasher (or if you're like me-both) later. It's possible to spend less time cleaning only as you spent time slaving over a hot stove. Oh wait! Make that no time slaving over a hot cooker. After clean up is complete you can contact enjoying the sunshine set, chasing the lightening bugs with your small ones, or even waiting for the very first superstar.
