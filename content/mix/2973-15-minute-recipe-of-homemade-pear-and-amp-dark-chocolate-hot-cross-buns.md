recipeinstructions:

- "Warm the milk for 25 seconds in a microwave. Add the yeast to the milk and let it stand for about 10 minutes until frothy."
- "Sift the flour into a large bowl and cut the butter into it. Rub the butter into the flour until it resembles fine breadcrumbs.

- "Pre-heat your oven to 200 C / Gas 6."
- "Whilst the buns are proving prepare the ‘cross’ mixture. Just add the flour and water together and give it a good beating with a fork until it’s well blended and not lumpy. Add to a piping bag (or a plastic bag with a corner cut off). Once the 30 minutes are up just pipe the crosses across the top of each bun."
- "Bake for 30 minutes."
- "About 10 minutes before they come out of the oven, prepare your glaze. Simply add the sugar and water to a small saucepan and heat until all the sugar has dissolved. Once they come out of the oven, whilst still hot, brush over the top of each bun."
- "Let them cool. They are ready to eat once the glaze has set. You can eat them warm or cool – your choice."
- "Stored in an airtight container they last for a couple of days."

Getting A Healthy Eater


After the weather warms up, the kitchen may be a terrible place to be.

So, how does crock pot cooking really help beat the heat? To put it simply, the crock pot in and of itself sets off a lot less heat compared to cooking compared to an oven or stove top. Here is the very first and maybe the very best reason to utilize the crock pot in summer time meal planning. You should also consider that by not heating your house by using your stove top or oven you are also avoiding your air conditioning (or other cooling systems ) from working overtime to be able to compensate for the extra heat that other cooking methods pose.

This makes crock pot cooking a win-win scenario as the costs involved in managing a crock pot are far less compared to the costs involved in operating a cooker or stove generally. Whether gas or electric, your cooker and oven tend to be considerable energy hogs. Add to that the fact that you're not raising the temperature in your house by traditional means of cooking and you're using less electricity.

 The simple reality is that the crock pot should be one of your most loved and most frequently utilized cooking approaches in the event you're able to handle it. When it comes to cooking with a crock pot, the choices are almost limitless.  Almost anything that can be baked can be made in the crock pot and many, many more wonderful and enticing foods and treats too.

Benefits of Crock Pot Cooking

Besides the cost benefits mentioned above when it comes to crock pot cooking there are a number of other benefits that are well worth mentioning. First of all, the bulk of the work entailed with crock pot cooking takes place early in the afternoon when you're refreshed rather than at the conclusion of a hectic work or play day. This usually means that you are not as inclined to forget a component or make different mistakes that often occur as we prepare a dinner when we are exhausted in the activities of our day.

Secondly, many good crock pot recipes include the vegetables that guarantee we are getting the nutrients we need. So frequently, when preparing a meal in the last minute, vegetables and other side dishes are made in favor of expedience. Crock pot cooking many cases is a meal in one dish.

 Unlike pans and pans, most crock pot meals are created in 1 dish. This means that there won't be mountains of meals to be hand cleaned or loaded to the dishwasher (or if you are like me-both) afterwards. It is possible to spend less time cleaning just as you spent time slaving over a hot cooker. Oh wait! Make that no time slaving over a hot cooker. Once tidy is complete you can contact enjoying the sun set, chasing the lightening bugs with your little ones, or even waiting for your very first star.

While there'll never be a one size fits all best cooking system, crock pot cooking comes really near. If you have a crock pot collecting dust somewhere at the rear of your pantry it is time to get out it, dust in the off, and dig up some fantastic summertime crock pot cooking recipes.
