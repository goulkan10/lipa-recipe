Tons of flavor and could be completely vegetarian if vegetable broth is substituted for the chicken broth. This one brings together the sweetness of delicata squash and the festive flavour of fresh sage in a tender buttery biscuit. The squash gives a lovely golden hue to these biscuits which are flecked. Delicata squash is a cream colored winter squash with green and orange stripes. It&#39;s shaped kind of like a Zeppelin or a blimp, shown below.
