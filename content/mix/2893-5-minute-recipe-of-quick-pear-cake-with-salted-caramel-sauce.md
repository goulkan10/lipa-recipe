This means that there isn't going to be mountains of dishes to be either hand washed or packed into the dishwasher (or if you are like me-both) afterwards. It's possible to spend less time cleaning only as you spent time slaving over a hot cooker. Oh wait! Ensure time slaving over a hot cooker. Once tidy is complete you can get back to enjoying the sunshine set, chasing the lightening bugs along with your little ones, or even waiting for the very first star.

While there will be no one size fits all best cooking procedure, crock pot cooking comes very near. If you have a crock pot gathering dust somewhere in the back of your pantry it's the right time to get it out, dust if off, and dig some terrific summertime crock pot cooking recipes.
