Getting A Healthy Eater

    
Camp cooking can be as complicated or simple as you want it to be. If you wish to prepare fast and easy but healthy meals when you are swimming, camp cooking does not even have to need a fire. But if you're interested in ridding your camping excursion with a feast, then camp cooking can enable you to make hot, healthy foods which are as good as you can make them at home in your own kitchen.

 Almost any cooking system you are using in the kitchen can be replicated around the home. For instance, use a dutch oven or pit cooking to bake your meals. You may also easily bake foods in a pan over a grill, or boil, braise and roast. Which type of camping cookware is best for you? Camp cooking and cleanup can be easy or a hassle, it all starts with great camping gear.

Some pots/pans come in places that mate together or"nest" for storage and also let you tuck a spoonful of fuel inside them. This comes in handy once you're wanting to save space whilst camping.

Following are some camping items to carry with you if you are planning on preparing some meals around the home. These frequent kitchen items allow you to replicate yummy meals when you are out of doorways.


• Other of your favourite herbs and spices
• Cooking oil
• Pot holder

• Aluminum foil

• Cutting knives
• Cutting board
• Mixing bowl


When you have just a few campers and are looking for some simple camp cooking, try the easy and fast technique of tin may cooking. All you will need is a fresh tin can -- a one gallon size may works well. Your source of heat can be a little campfire, or if wood burning is prohibited, a little buddy burner will work nicely, which can be located at sporting good stores or online. Put your meal in the tin can and just heat the contents of your own can over a fire. You will have a hot meal ready in seconds.  This technique works great for sauces, beans and tuna fish.

A more time-consuming camp cooking technique that also produces yummy meals is pit cooking.  It is also a wonderful camp cooking method if you're using a dutch oven or cast iron cookware. Pit cooking calms your food by heating stones and coals that are concealed in the floor. As the stones cool , their emitted heat cooks the food. To pit cookfirst dig a hole that's approximately three times bigger than your own cookware. Line the pit with stones and build a fire in the middle. Once the flame has burnt rapidly for approximately an hour, push the warm coals and rocks into the middle. Layer your wrapped meals covered skillets in addition to the stones and coals and place on top. After a couple of hours, you'll have some delicious camp food to relish.

It can be prepared in a jiffy with very few ingredients. The only thing about this dosa is, it should be eaten hot as it does not taste good when cold. I love dosas especially instant dosa as it comes handy when we do not have. This besan chilla recipe also called Rajasthani besan cheela is a tasty Indian pancake made of besan (gram flour), spices and herbs. Chilla or Cheela are popular Indian crepes.
