<i>Before you jump to Jalebi ice-cream sandwich recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about {<strong>The Simple Ways to Be Healthy</strong>.</i>
Becoming A Healthy Eater

    
Camp cooking can be as elaborate or simple as you would like it to be. If you wish to prepare fast and easy but nutritious meals when you're camping, camp cooking does not even need to need a fire. However, if you're thinking about fueling your camping trip using a feast, camp cooking can make it possible for you to earn hot, healthy foods that are as good as you can create them at home in your kitchen.

Camp cooking does not need to be limited to sandwiches and baked potatoes wrapped in aluminum foil.  Just about any cooking method you use in the kitchen can be duplicated around the campfire. For instance, use a dutch oven or pit cooking to consume your food. You might also easily fry foods in a bowl over a grill, or boil, braise and roast. Which sort of camping cookware is best for you? Camp cooking and clean-up can be easy or a hassle, but it all starts with great camping gear.

Some pots/pans arrive in sets that mate together or"nest" for storage and even let you tuck a spoonful of fuel inside them. This comes in handy when you're wanting to save room while camping.

Following are some camping items to carry with you if you're considering preparing some meals around the home. These common kitchen items will allow you to replicate yummy meals while you're out of doors.

• Salt and pepper
• Other your favorite herbs and spices
• Cooking oil
• Pot holder

• Aluminum foil

• Cutting knives
• Cutting board
• Mixing bowl
• Paper or plastic silverware, plates and cups

In case you have only a couple campers and are looking for some very simple camp cooking, try out the easy and fast technique of tin could cooking. All you will need is a clean tin can -- a 1 gallon size can works well. Your source of heat may be small campfire, or if wood burning is prohibited, a little buddy burner may work nicely, which can be seen at sporting good stores or online. Put your meal in the tin can and easily heat the contents of your own can over a fire.  This technique works great for soups, beans and tuna fish.

A more time-consuming camp cooking technique that also produces yummy food is pit cooking. Pit cooking is excellent for items that could be wrapped in aluminum foil to be cooked.  It is also a excellent camp cooking system if you're using a dutch oven or cast iron cookware. Pit cooking calms your meals by heating rocks and coals which are concealed in the ground. As the rocks cool , their emitted heat cooks the food. To pit cook, first dig a hole that is about three times larger than your cookware. Line the pit with rocks and create a fire in the middle. Once the fire has burned rapidly for about an hourpush the hot coals and rocks into the center. Layer your wrapped food covered skillets in addition to the rocks and coals and put more on top. After a few hours, you'll have some tasty camp food to relish.
