<i>Before you jump to Vegan Cookie dough recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about {<strong>The Simple Ways to Be Healthy</strong>.</i>
Getting A Healthy Eater

    
Camp cooking can be as elaborate or simple as you would like it to be. If you would like to prepare fast and easy but healthy meals while you're camping, camp cooking does not even need to need a flame. But if you're interested in ridding your camping excursion with a feast, then camp cooking can allow you to make hot, healthy foods that are as good as you can create them at home in your kitchen.

Camp cooking does not have to be limited to sandwiches and baked potatoes wrapped in aluminum foil.  Almost any cooking method you are using from the kitchen could be replicated around the campfire. For example, use a dutch oven or pit cooking to consume your meals. You can also easily fry foods in a bowl over a grill, or boil, braise and roast. Which kind of camping cookware is ideal for you? Camp cooking and cleanup may be easy or a hassle, but it all starts with great camping equipment.

Some pots/pans arrive in sets that mate collectively or"nest" for storage and even allow you to tuck a spoonful of fuel inside them. This comes in handy when you're searching to save space while camping.

Following are some camping things to carry with you if you're thinking about preparing some meals around the campfire. These common kitchen items will allow you to duplicate tasty meals as you're out of doorways.


• Other your favorite herbs and spices
• Cooking oil
• Pot holder
• Hand-held can opener
• Aluminum foil
• Tongs and spatula
• Cutting knives
• Cutting board
• Mixing bowl
• Paper or plastic silverware, plates and cups

In case you have only a few campers and are looking for some easy camp cooking, try out the simple and fast technique of tin may cooking. All you'll need is a clean tin can -- a 1 gallon size can works nicely. Your source of warmth can be a little campfire, or when wood burning is illegal, a little buddy burner may work nicely, which may be found at sporting good stores or online. Put your meal in the tin can and just heat the contents of your can over a fire. You will have a hot meal ready in seconds.  This technique works great for sauces, beans and poultry.

A more time-consuming camp cooking technique that also produces delectable food is pit cooking.  It is also a excellent camp cooking method if you are using a dutch oven or cast iron cookware. Pit cooking warms your food by heating rocks and coals which are buried in the ground. As the stones cool off, their emitted heat cooks the meals. To pit cook, first dig a hole that is approximately three times larger than your own cookware. Line the pit with rocks and build a fire in the center. When the flame has burned rapidly for approximately an hour, push the hot coals and stone into the middle. Layer your wrapped food covered skillets in addition to the stones and coals and put more on top. Following a couple of hours, you will have some delicious camp food to enjoy.
