This means that there isn't going to be mountains of meals to be hand washed or loaded into the dishwasher (or if you are like me-both) later. It is possible to spend less time cleaning as you spent less time slaving over a hot cooker. Oh wait! Ensure no time slaving over a hot stove. Once tidy is complete you can get back to enjoying the sunshine set, pursuing the lightening bugs with your little ones, or waiting for your very first celebrity.
