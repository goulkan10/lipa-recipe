Pot roasts typically use the tougher cuts of beef—a chuck roast or shoulder roast—which have the most flavor. Slow cooking at low heat is what melts the tough connective tissue between the muscle fibers, leaving you with tender meat that pulls apart with your fork. For pot roasts, and other slow cooked tough meats, fat is your friend! Pot Roast - fall apart beef, tender flavour infused vegetables and potatoes smothered in a rich gravy. It&#39;s mouthwateringly good, yet simple to make, especially if you use a slow cooker.
