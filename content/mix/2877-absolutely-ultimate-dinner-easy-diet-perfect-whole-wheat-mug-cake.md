Getting A Healthy Eater


When the weather warms up, the kitchen may be a terrible place to be. There are a number of things you can do however, in regards to cooking a wonderful homemade meal which does not need conventional stove top or oven cooking. Learn to utilize some of these heat producing equipment in your kitchen, such as the crock pot, to be able to truly beat the summer heat and keep your cool when preparing a great hot meal for friends and family.

So, how can crock pot cooking help overcome the heat? Simply put, the crock pot in and of itself sets off far less heat when cooking compared to an oven or stove top. Here is the very first and possibly the very best reason to utilize the crock pot on summer time meal planning. You should also consider that by not heating your home by employing your stove or oven you're also avoiding your air conditioning (or additional cooling methods) from working overtime in order to compensate for the additional heat that other cooking systems introduce.

This leaves crock pot cooking a win-win situation since the costs involved with operating a crock marijuana are much less compared to the expenses related to managing a cooker or stove in general. Whether electric or gas, your stove and oven are often significant energy hogs. Add to that the fact that you are not raising the temperature in your house by traditional means of cooking and you are using even less power.

 The reality is that the crock pot should be one of your most loved and most frequently utilized cooking approaches in the event that you're able to manage it.  Virtually anything that can be boiled could be reached in the crock pot and many, many more wonderful and enticing foods and treats too.



Along with the cost benefits mentioned previously as it pertains to crock pot cooking there are quite a few different advantages that are well worth mentioning. First of all, the majority of the work entailed with crock pot cooking occurs early in the day when you are refreshed instead of at the end of a frantic work or play day. This usually means that you're less likely to forget an ingredient or make different mistakes which often happen as we hurriedly prepare a dinner when we are exhausted from the activities of daily.

Secondly, many good crock pot recipes incorporate the vegetables that guarantee we are getting the nutrients that we need. So often, when preparing a meal in the last minute, vegetables and other side dishes have been left out in favor of expedience. Crock pot cooking in many cases is a meal in one dish.

Another great reason to use a crock pot for your summertime cooking is the ease of clean up.  Unlike vegetables and pans, most crock pot dishes are created in one dish. This means that there will not be mountains of meals to be hand washed or loaded to the dishwasher (or if you are like me-both) later. It is possible to spend less time cleaning just as you spent less time slaving over a hot stove. Oh wait! Make that time slaving over a hot stove. Once clean up is complete you can contact enjoying the sun set, pursuing the lightening bugs along with your little ones, or even waiting for the very first celebrity.

While there'll be no one size fits all best cooking method, crock pot cooking comes very close. When you've got a crock pot gathering dust somewhere at the back of your pantry it is the right time to get out it, dust off, and dig some excellent summertime crock pot cooking recipes.

This is my own version of the chocolate microwave mug cake. Whole-wheat flour, cocoa powder greek yogurt, and naturally sweetened with maple syrup, this mug cake is perfect for those days when you want a sweet start to the day. This mug treat delivers all of the comforting flavors of a cinnamon-roll breakfast, but with more fiber and nutrition. I perfected these whole wheat pancakes after testing batches and batches until they were just right. Everything a whole wheat pancake should be - fluffy I can see myself making all kinds of desserts replacing lady fingers and cake layers with these pancakes.
