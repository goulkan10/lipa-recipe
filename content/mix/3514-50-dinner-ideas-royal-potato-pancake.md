Camp cooking can be as elaborate or simple as you want it to be. If you want to prepare fast and simple but healthy meals while you are swimming, camp cooking doesn't even need to need a fire. However, if you're interested in fueling your camping excursion with a feast, camp cooking can enable you to earn hot, healthy foods which are as good as you can create them at home in your own kitchen.

Camp cooking doesn't have to be limited to sandwiches and baked potatoes wrapped in aluminum foil.  Almost any cooking procedure you are using in the kitchen could be replicated around the home. For instance, use a toaster or pit cooking to bake your meals. You may also easily fry foods at a bowl over a grill, or boil, braise and roast. Which kind of camping cookware is best for you? Camp cooking and clean-up may be easy or a hassle, but it all starts with great camping gear.

Some pots/pans arrive in sets that mate together or"nest" for storage and also allow you to tuck a canister of gas within them. This comes in handy when you're trying to save room whilst camping.

When you have only a couple campers and are looking for some very easy camp cooking, try out the easy and quick technique of tin could cooking. All you will need is a clean tin can -- a 1 gallon size can works nicely. Your source of warmth can be a small campfire, or when wood burning is prohibited, a small buddy burner will work nicely, which can be found at sporting good stores or online. Place your meal in the tin can and easily warm the contents of your own can over a flame.  This technique works great for soups, beans and tuna fish.

A more time-consuming pub cooking technique which also produces yummy food is pit cooking. Pit cooking is wonderful for items that may be wrapped in aluminum foil to be cooked.  It is also a great camp cooking system if you are using a dutch oven or cast iron cookware. Pit cooking calms your food by heating stones and coals that are concealed in the ground. As the stones cool away, their emitted heat cooks the meals. To pit cookfirst dig a hole that's about three times larger than your own cookware. Line the pit with stones and build a fire in the middle. When the fire has burned rapidly for approximately one hour, push the warm coals and stones into the middle. Layer your wrapped food or covered skillets in addition to the rocks and coals and place on top. After a few hours, you'll have some delicious camp food to relish.
