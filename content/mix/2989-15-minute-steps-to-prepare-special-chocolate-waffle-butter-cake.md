Becoming A Healthy Eater

    
Camp cooking can be as elaborate or simple as you want it to be. If you wish to prepare quick and easy but nutritious meals as you are camping, camp cooking doesn't even have to require a fire. But if you are interested in fueling your camping excursion using a feast, then camp cooking can make it possible for you to earn hot, healthy foods which are as great as you can create them at home in your kitchen.

Camp cooking doesn't have to be limited to sandwiches and baked potatoes wrapped in aluminum foil.  Just about any cooking system you use from the kitchen can be duplicated around the campfire. For instance, use a dutch oven or pit cooking to bake your food. You can also easily bake foods in a pan over a grill, or boil, braise and beverage. Which type of camping cookware is best for you? Camp cooking and cleanup can be easy or a hassle, and it all starts with great camping gear.

Some pots/pans come in places that mate together or"nest" for storage and even let you tuck a canister of gas within them. This also comes in handy when you're looking to save space while camping.

Listed below are some camping things to take with you if you are planning on preparing some meals around the campfire. These frequent kitchen items allow you to replicate yummy meals when you're out of doors.


• Other your favourite herbs and spices
• Cooking oil
• Pot holder
• Hand-held can opener
• Aluminum foil

• Cutting knives
• Cutting board
• Mixing bowl


If you have only a couple campers and are looking for some simple camp cooking, try out the easy and fast technique of tin can cooking. All you will need is a clean tin can -- a one gallon size may works well. Your source of warmth may be little campfire, or if wood burning is prohibited, a little buddy burner may work well, which may be located at sporting good stores or online. Place your meal from the tin can and easily heat the contents of your own can over a flame. You'll have a hot meal ready in seconds.  This technique works great for soups, beans and poultry.

A more time-consuming camp cooking technique which also produces delectable food is pit cooking. Pit cooking is terrific for items which can be wrapped in aluminum foil to be cooked.  It's also a wonderful camp cooking system if you're using a dutch oven or cast iron cookware. Pit cooking warms your meals by heating rocks and coals that are buried in the ground. As the rocks cool , their emitted heat cooks the meals. To pit cookfirst dig a hole that's about three times bigger than your cookware. Line the pit with rocks and create a fire in the middle. Once the fire has burned rapidly for approximately one hour, push the hot coals and stone into the middle. Layer your wrapped food covered skillets on top of the rocks and coals and put more on top. After a few hours, you'll have some tasty camp food to relish.
