Make sure and be really careful when cooking the fry bread. Take these Indian Tacos up a notch and serve them with a little taco sauce that that is seasoned with smoked paprika. I&#39;m not sure exactly what the sauce they use at the fair is made of, but this is as close as I&#39;ve tried. Stir in chili seasoning mix, ranch-style beans, and diced tomatoes with green chilies. Add the meat and brown with the onions.
