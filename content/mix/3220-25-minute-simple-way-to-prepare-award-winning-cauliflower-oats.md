Becoming A Healthy Eater

    
Camp cooking can be as elaborate or simple as you would like it to be. If you want to prepare quick and simple but healthy meals as you're camping, camp cooking doesn't even need to require a flame. However, if you are interested in fueling your camping excursion having a feast, camp cooking can enable you to make hot, healthy foods that are as great as you can make them at home in your own kitchen.

Camp cooking does not have to be limited to sandwiches and baked potatoes wrapped in aluminum foil.  Almost any cooking system you are using from the kitchen could be replicated around the home. For instance, use a toaster or pit cooking to bake your meals. You might also easily fry foods in a bowl over a grill, or boil, braise and beverage. Which type of camping cookware is best for you? Camp cooking and clean-up can be easy or a hassle, but it all starts with great camping equipment.

Some pots/pans come in sets that partner together or"nest" for storage and even let you tuck a spoonful of gas within them. This really also comes in handy when you're searching to save room while camping.

Following are some camping things to consider with you if you are thinking about preparing some meals around the campfire. These frequent kitchen items allow you to duplicate tasty meals while you are out of doors.


• Other your favourite herbs and spices
• Cooking oil
• Pot holder
• Hand-held can opener
• Aluminum foil

• Cutting knives
• Cutting board
• Mixing bowl
• Paper or plastic silverware, plates and cups

When you have just a few campers and are searching for some easy camp cooking, try the simple and speedy technique of tin could cooking. All you will need is a clean tin can -- a 1 gallon size may works well. Your source of warmth may be small campfire, or if wood burning is prohibited, a little buddy burner will work well, which can be seen at sporting good stores or online. Place your meal from the tin can and easily heat the contents of your can over a flame.  This technique works great for sauces, beans and tuna fish.

A more time-consuming pub cooking technique which also produces delectable meals is pit cooking. Pit cooking is great for items which can be wrapped in aluminum foil to be cooked.  It's also a excellent camp cooking method if you are using a dutch oven or cast iron cookware. Pit cooking calms your food by heating rocks and coals that are buried in the ground. As the stones cool off, their emitted heat cooks the food. To pit cook, first dig a hole that is approximately three times larger than your cookware. Line the pit with stones and construct a fire in the center. When the fire has burned rapidly for about one hour, push the hot coals and stones into the middle. Layer your wrapped meals covered skillets on top of the rocks and coals and place on top. After a few hours, you'll have some delicious camp food to enjoy.
