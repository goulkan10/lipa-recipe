This usually means that there is not going to be mountains of meals to be either hand cleaned or loaded into the dishwasher (or in case you're like me-both) afterwards. You can spend less time cleaning as you spent time slaving over a hot stove. Oh wait! Ensure time slaving over a hot cooker. After clean up is complete you can contact enjoying the sun set, pursuing the lightening bugs with your little ones, or even waiting for the very first star.
