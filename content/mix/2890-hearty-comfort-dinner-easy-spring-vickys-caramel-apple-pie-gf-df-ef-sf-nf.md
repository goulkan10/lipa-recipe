recipeingredient:
- "115 grams goldfoil Stork margarine or unsalted butter"
- "2 tbsp cornflourcornstarch"
- "1 tbsp glutenfree flour"
- "30 ml water"
- "1 tbsp vanilla extract"
- "100 grams white sugar"
- "110 grams light brown sugar"
- "1 tsp ground cinnamon"
- "1/4 tsp ground nutmeg"
- "6 granny smith apples peeled cored and diced"
- "1 sweetened short crust pastry enough for a double pie crust shell  lid Ive got my freefrom recipe linked below if you need one"
recipeinstructions:
- "Melt the butter in a saucepan. Stir in both flours. It won&#39;t look pretty but don&#39;t worry"
- "Add the water, vanilla, spices and both sugars and bring to the boil, stirring continuously to bring the caramel together"
- "Reduce to a simmer and add the sliced apples, letting them cook slightly in the syrup before letting it cool and thicken"
- "Preheat the oven to gas 7 / 210C / 425°F and line a 9 inch pie tin with baking paper or use a spring form cake tin"
- "Roll out the pastry and press into the pie tin cutting off the excess to roll again for the top crust. Chill in the fridge until the filling has cooled  https://cookpad.com/us/recipes/332957-vickys-sweet-savoury-shortcrust-pastry-gf-df-ef-sf-nf"
- "Using a slotted spoon, scoop the filling into the pie shell. This way you can control the amount of caramel that goes in so it won&#39;t be too liquidy and the bottom crust doesn&#39;t get soggy. Reserve the rest of the syrup for serving later. Mound the filling up slightly in the middle"
- "Brush the edge of the shell with some milk or an alternative such as light coconut milk, then top with the lid pastry, cutting a slit on top for steam to escape"
- "If you still have some pastry left, roll it out again and cut out some decorative leaves with a knife and place on top to make it prettier"
- "Crimp the edge of the lid and bottom crust together to seal and brush some of the leftover caramel syrup all over the lid to glaze"
- "Bake 15 minutes in the oven (over a baking tray in case there are spills), then reduce the temperature to gas 4 / 180C / 350°F and bake for a further 35 to 45 minutes or until the apples are soft and the pastry is golden"
- "Let cool for 10 minutes in the tin, then cool completely out of the tin on a wire rack. Serve warm but not hot (or you&#39;ll lose all of the syrup!) with ice cream, custard or some fresh cream - full fat coconut milk is a lovely non-dairy cream substitute  https://cookpad.com/us/recipes/332956-vickys-vanilla-ice-cream-with-flavour-variations-gf-df-ef-sf-nf https://cookpad.com/us/recipes/332987-vickys-vanilla-custard-gluten-dairy-egg-soy-nut-free"
- "I hope you try this, everyone in my family that&#39;s tried it really loves it"
- "TIPS TO AVOID A SOGGY PIE BOTTOM! Let the pie cool on a wire rack completely to let the warmth circulate around the base. Reheat to serve, don&#39;t be tempted to cut into it straight from the oven. Using a glass pie dish helps cook the bottom crust better than a metal tin too. Also, if you brush the inside of the shell with some syrup it stops the filling seeping through. If a recipe says add the filling hot, add it hot. And of course you can blind bake the shell before filling. Hope these are useful to you!"

<i>Before you jump to Vickys Caramel Apple Pie, GF DF EF SF NF recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about {<strong>The Simple Ways to Be Healthy</strong>.</i>
Getting A Healthy Eater

    
Camp cooking can be as elaborate or simple as you would like it to be. If you want to prepare fast and simple but healthy meals as you're camping, camp cooking does not even need to need a fire. However, if you are thinking about ridding your camping excursion using a feast, then camp cooking can allow you to make warm, healthy foods which are as great as you can create them at home in your own kitchen.

 Just about any cooking process you are using in the kitchen can be replicated around the home. For example, use a toaster or pit cooking to consume your meals. You might also easily fry foods in a bowl over a grill, or boil, braise and roast. Which kind of camping cookware is best for you? Camp cooking and clean-up can be easy or a hassle, and it all starts with great camping equipment.

Some pots/pans arrive in places that mate jointly or"nest" for storage and also allow you to tuck a spoonful of fuel inside them. This comes in handy once you're looking to save space whilst camping.

Following are some camping items to consider with you if you're planning on preparing some meals around the home. These frequent kitchen items will allow you to replicate yummy meals while you are out of doors.

• Salt and pepper
• Other your favourite herbs and spices
• Cooking oil
• Pot holder
• Hand-held can opener
• Aluminum foil

• Cutting knives
• Cutting board
• Mixing bowl
• Paper or plastic silverware, plates and cups

If you have just a couple campers and are searching for some simple camp cooking, try out the easy and speedy technique of tin may cooking. All you will need is a fresh tin can -- a 1 gallon size can works well. Your source of heat can be a small campfire, or when wood burning is prohibited, a small buddy burner may work well, which can be located at sporting good stores or online. Put your meal in the tin can and simply warm the contents of your own can over a flame.  This technique works great for sauces, beans and tuna fish.

A more time-consuming pub cooking technique that also produces yummy meals is pit cooking.  It's also a excellent camp cooking system if you're using a dutch oven or cast iron cookware. Pit cooking warms your meals by heating stones and coals that are buried in the floor. As the rocks cool away, their emitted heat cooks the meals. To pit cook, first dig a hole that's approximately three times larger than your cookware. Line the pit with rocks and create a fire in the center. Once the flame has burned rapidly for approximately an hourpush the hot coals and stone into the middle. Layer your wrapped food covered skillets on top of the stones and coals and place on top. After a number of hours, you will have some tasty camp food to enjoy.
