Becoming A Healthy Eater

Whether your Travel on the go or round the

Pack a lot of weight if you make it a habit.
If you eat out at restaurants, constantly be smart

At home
Evenings and mornings are busy intervals in many homes.
Obtaining the time to consume can be difficult, though you
Should not run outside the door without eating breakfast
first. Cereal with milk, a banana, muffin, or even
A bagel is a good way to start the day.

Anytime You're on the move, always make sure that you
Make the perfect food choices. 
Food with you if you will need to, so that you have it

Yes, the recipe is exactly the same except it was wrapped in banana leaves and in triangular shape. This is not a kuih that I am very familiar as it was not that common in East Malaysia. Remove banana leaves, coat kuih lopes with grated coconut and serve with palm sugar syrup. Posted by Any dish on the continent of Asia that&#39;s served over rice can be served over coconut rice for an extra hit of flavor. Simply substitute half the water for coconut milk, and you&#39;re good to go.
