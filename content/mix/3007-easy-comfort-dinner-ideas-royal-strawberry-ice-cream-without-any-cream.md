Becoming A Healthy Eater

    
Camp cooking can be as elaborate or simple as you would like it to be. If you want to prepare quick and easy but healthy meals as you are camping, camp cooking doesn't even have to require a flame. However, if you are considering fueling your camping excursion having a feast, camp cooking can allow you to make hot, healthy foods that are as good as you can create them at home in your own kitchen.

 Just about any cooking procedure you use from the kitchen can be duplicated around the campfire. For instance, use a dutch oven or pit cooking to bake your food. You could also easily bake foods in a pan over a grill, or boil, braise and roast. What sort of camping cookware is best for you? Camp cooking and clean-up can be easy or a hassle, and it all starts with great camping gear.

Some pots/pans come in sets that partner jointly or"nest" for storage and even let you tuck a spoonful of gas within them. This comes in handy when you're looking to save room while camping.

Following are some camping items to carry with you if you're considering preparing some meals around the home. These frequent kitchen items will allow you to duplicate tasty meals when you're out of doors.

‚Ä¢ Salt and pepper
‚Ä¢ Other your favorite herbs and spices
‚Ä¢ Cooking oil
‚Ä¢ Pot holder

‚Ä¢ Aluminum foil
‚Ä¢ Tongs and spatula
‚Ä¢ Cutting knives
‚Ä¢ Cutting board
‚Ä¢ Mixing bowl


If you have only a couple of campers and are looking for some simple camp cooking, try out the simple and quick technique of tin could cooking. All you'll need is a fresh tin can -- a 1 gallon size may works nicely. Your source of heat may be little campfire, or if wood burning is prohibited, a little buddy burner will work nicely, which may be seen at sporting good stores or online. Put your meal from the tin can and just heat the contents of your own can over a fire. You will have a hot meal ready in seconds.  This technique works great for sauces, beans and tuna fish.

A more time-consuming pub cooking technique which also produces tasty food is pit cooking. Pit cooking is fantastic for items that can be wrapped in aluminum foil to be cooked.  It's also a great camp cooking system if you are using a dutch oven or cast iron cookware. Pit cooking warms your food by heating rocks and coals that are buried in the ground. As the rocks cool off, their emitted heat cooks the meals. To pit cook, first dig a hole that's about three times bigger than your cookware. Line the pit with stones and create a fire in the middle. When the fire has burned rapidly for about one hourpush the hot coals and stone into the center. Layer your wrapped food covered skillets on top of the rocks and coals and put more on top. After a few hours, you'll have some tasty camp food to enjoy.
