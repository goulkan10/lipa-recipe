Becoming A Healthy Eater

    
Camp cooking can be as elaborate or simple as you would like it to be. If you would like to prepare quick and simple but healthy meals while you're camping, camp cooking doesn't even have to require a fire. But if you are considering ridding your camping excursion with a feast, camp cooking can allow you to make warm, healthy foods that are as good as you can create them at home in your kitchen.

 Just about any cooking system you are using in the kitchen could be duplicated around the home. For example, use a dutch oven or pit cooking to bake your meals. You may also easily bake foods at a pan over a grill, or boil, braise and roast. Which kind of camping cookware is ideal for you? Camp cooking and clean-up can be easy or a hassle, but it all starts with great camping gear.

Some pots/pans come in places that partner together or"nest" for storage and even let you tuck a spoonful of gas within them. This really also comes in handy once you're seeking to save room whilst camping.

Following are some camping things to carry with you if you are planning on preparing some meals around the campfire. These common kitchen items will allow you to duplicate tasty meals when you are out of doors.

• Salt and pepper
• Other your favorite herbs and spices
• Cooking oil
• Pot holder
• Hand-held can opener
• Aluminum foil

• Cutting knives
• Cutting board
• Mixing bowl
• Paper or plastic silverware, plates and cups

If you have just a couple campers and are searching for some simple camp cooking, try the simple and fast technique of tin could cooking. All you will need is a fresh tin can -- a 1 gallon size can works nicely. Your source of heat can be a little campfire, or if wood burning is illegal, a small buddy burner may work well, which can be found at sporting good stores or online. Put your meal from the tin could and easily warm the contents of your own can over a flame.  This technique works great for soups, beans and tuna fish.

A more time-consuming camp cooking technique that also produces yummy meals is pit cooking. Pit cooking is excellent for items that could be wrapped in aluminum foil to be cooked.  It's also a wonderful camp cooking method if you are using a dutch oven or cast iron cookware. Pit cooking calms your meals by heating stones and coals that are buried in the floor. As the stones cool off, their emitted heat cooks the meals. To pit cook, first dig a hole that's about three times bigger than your cookware. Line the pit with rocks and create a fire in the center. When the fire has burned rapidly for about one hourpush the warm coals and stone into the center. Twist your wrapped food covered skillets in addition to the stones and coals and place more on top. Following a couple of hours, you will have some delicious camp food to enjoy.
