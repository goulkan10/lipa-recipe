- "1/4 cup brown sugar"
- "1/4 cup white sugar"
- "1 egg yolk"
- "1/2 cup milk of choice"
- "1/2 cup water"
- "4 1/4 tsp active dry yeast"

- "1 1/2 tsp vanilla"
- "3/4 tsp salt"
- "1/2 tsp cinnamon"
- "1/2 tsp nutmeg"
- "1/4 tsp ginger"
- "1 egg for eggwash"
recipeinstructions:
- "Combine the water and milk in a mediumsaucepan and warm over low heat until about 100°F (but no more than 110 degrees). Remove from heat and sprinkle the yeast and a pinch of sugar and flour over the surface of the liquid. Set aside without stirring, until foamy and rising up the sides of the pan, about 30 minutes."
- "Whisk the butter, egg yolk and vanilla into the yeast mixture."
- "Whisk the flour, the remaining sugar, salt,nutmeg, cinnamon and ginger in a large bowl. Make a well in the center of the flour and stir in the yeast mixture with a wooden spoon to make a thick, shaggy, and slightly sticky dough. Stir in currants. Turn the dough onto a lightly floured work surface and knead until soft and elastic, about 8 minutes. Shape into a ball."
- "Brush the inside of a large bowl with butter. Put dough in bowl, turning to coat lightly with butter. Cover with plastic wrap. Let rise at room temperature until doubled in size, about 1 hour 30 minutes. (If you have a marker, trace a circle the size of the dough on the plastic, and note the time to help you keep track.)"
- "To form the rolls: Butter a 9 by 14-inch baking pan. Turn the dough out of the bowl and pat into a rectangle about 16 by 8 inches. Divide the dough into 12 equal portions, about 2 ounces each, with a pizzawheel or bench scraper. (If you don&#39;t have a scale, divide the dough in half lengthwise, then in half crosswise. Cut each of those four sections into 3 equal-sized rolls.)"
- "Tuck the edges of the dough under to make round rolls and place them seam-side down in the prepared pan, leaving a little space in between each roll. Cover the pan with buttered plastic wrap and set aside in a warm place until the rolls rise almost to the rim of the pan and have more than doubled in size, about 45 minutes."
- "Meanwhile, position a rack in the center of the oven and preheat to 375°F.Remove the plastic wrap and brush the tops of the buns with beaten egg. Bake rolls until golden brown and puffy, and an instant read thermometer inserted into the center of the rolls registers 190°F, about 25 minutes."

<i>Before you jump to Hot Cross Buns recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about {<strong>The Simple Ways to Be Healthy</strong>.</i>
Getting A Healthy Eater


After the weather outside warms up, the kitchen may be a horrible place to be. There are a lot of things that you can do however, in regards to cooking a wonderful homemade meal which doesn't require traditional stove top or oven cooking. Learn to utilize some of those lesser heat producing equipment in your own kitchen, such as the crock pot, in order to truly conquer the summertime and maintain your cool when preparing a nice warm meal for friends and family.

So, how does crock pot cooking really help beat the heat? To put it simply, that the crock pot in and of itself puts off much less heat compared to cooking than the oven or stove top. This is the very first and maybe the very best reason to use the crock pot on your summer meal preparation. You should also look at the fact that by not heating your house by using your stove top or oven you're also preventing your air conditioning (or alternative cooling methods) from working overtime to be able to compensate for the extra heat which other cooking systems introduce.

This makes crock pot cooking a win-win scenario since the costs involved in operating a crock pot are much less than the costs involved in operating a cooker or stove generally. Whether electric or gas, your stove and oven are often considerable energy hogs. Add to this the fact that you're not raising the warmth in your home by traditional way of cooking and you're using less energy.

 The simple truth is that the crock pot ought to be one of your most loved and most often utilized cooking methods if you can manage it.  Virtually anything that can be boiled could be reached in the crock pot and many, many more wonderful and enticing meals and snacks too.

Benefits of Crock Pot Cooking

In addition to the cost benefits mentioned above when it comes to crock pot cooking there are many different benefits which are well worth mentioning. First of all, the majority of the work involved with crock pot cooking takes place early in the day when you're refreshed rather than at the conclusion of a frantic work or play day. This usually means that you are less inclined to forget an ingredient or make other errors which frequently happen as we prepare a dinner when we are exhausted in the activities of daily.

Secondly, many good crock pot recipes incorporate the vegetables that insure we are getting the nutrients that we need. So often, when preparing a meal at the last minute, vegetables and other side dishes have been made in favour of expedience. Crock pot cooking many instances is a meal in 1 dish.

Another great reason to use a crock pot for the summertime cooking is the ease of clean up.  Unlike pots and pans, most crock pot foods are created in one dish. This means that there will not be mountains of meals to be hand washed or loaded into the dishwasher (or if you're like me-both) later. You can spend less time cleaning as you spent time slaving over a hot cooker. Oh wait! Ensure no time slaving over a hot stove. Once clean up is complete you can contact enjoying the sunshine set, chasing the lightening bugs along with your small ones, or waiting for the very first star.

While there'll never be a one size fits all ideal cooking method, crock pot cooking comes very close. In case you have a crock pot collecting dust somewhere at the rear of your pantry it is time to get out it, dust if offand dig some great summertime crock pot cooking recipes.
