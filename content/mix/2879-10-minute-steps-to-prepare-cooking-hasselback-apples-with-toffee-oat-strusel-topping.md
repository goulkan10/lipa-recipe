<i>Before you jump to Hasselback Apples with Toffee / Oat Strusel Topping recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about {<strong>The Simple Ways to Be Healthy</strong>.</i>
Getting A Healthy Eater

    
Camp cooking can be as elaborate or simple as you would like it to be. If you would like to prepare fast and easy but nutritious meals as you're swimming, camp cooking does not even have to require a flame. But if you're thinking about fueling your camping trip using a feast, then camp cooking can allow you to make warm, healthy foods that are as good as you can make them at home in your kitchen.

Camp cooking doesn't have to be limited to sandwiches and baked potatoes wrapped in aluminum foil.  Just about any cooking process you are using in the kitchen can be replicated around the campfire. For example, use a toaster or pit cooking to consume your food. You could also easily bake foods in a pan over a grill, or boil, braise and roast. Which type of camping cookware is ideal for you? Camp cooking and clean-up can be easy or a hassle, but it all starts with great camping equipment.

Some pots/pans come in sets that partner collectively or"nest" for storage and even allow you to tuck a spoonful of gas within them. This really comes in handy once you're looking to save space while camping.

Following are some camping items to take with you if you're thinking about preparing some meals around the campfire. These common kitchen items allow you to duplicate tasty meals when you're out of doorways.


• Other your favourite herbs and spices
• Cooking oil
• Pot holder

• Aluminum foil
• Tongs and spatula
• Cutting knives
• Cutting board
• Mixing bowl


If you have only a few campers and are searching for some easy camp cooking, try the simple and quick technique of tin could cooking. All you will need is a fresh tin can -- a 1 gallon size may works well. Your source of warmth may be small campfire, or if wood burning is prohibited, a little buddy burner will work nicely, which can be seen at sporting good stores or online. Place your meal from the tin could and just warm the contents of your own can over a flame. You'll have a hot meal ready in minutes.  This technique works great for sauces, beans and poultry.

A more time-consuming camp cooking technique that also produces yummy food is pit cooking.  It is also a great camp cooking method if you're using a dutch oven or cast iron cookware. Pit cooking calms your food by heating stones and coals that are buried in the floor. As the rocks cool off, their emitted heat cooks the meals. To pit cook, first dig a hole that is approximately three times larger than your own cookware. Line the pit with stones and build a fire in the middle. When the flame has burnt rapidly for approximately an hourpush the hot coals and rocks into the middle. Twist your wrapped meals or covered skillets in addition to the rocks and coals and place on top. After a couple of hours, you'll have some tasty camp food to enjoy.
