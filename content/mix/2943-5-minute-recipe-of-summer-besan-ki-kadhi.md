This is the first and maybe the very best reason to utilize the crock pot on summer time meal preparation. You should also look at that by not heating the house by employing your stove or oven you're also preventing your air conditioning (or additional heating systems ) from working overtime so as to compensate for the additional heat that other cooking systems introduce.

This leaves crock pot cooking a win-win scenario as the expenses involved with operating a crock pot are far less than the costs involved in operating a stove or oven in general. Whether gas or electric, your stove and oven tend to be significant energy hogs. Add to this the fact that you are not increasing the warmth in your home by traditional way of cooking and you're using even less electricity.

Unfortunately for many, the general consensus has been the crock pots were intended for comfort foods and hearty winter meals.  The simple truth is that the crock pot ought to be one of the best loved and most frequently utilized cooking methods in case it is possible to handle it. When it comes to cooking with a crock pot, the choices are almost limitless.  Almost anything that can be boiled could be created in the crock pot and many, many more lovely and enticing foods and treats too.



Besides the cost advantages cited above as it pertains to crock pot cooking there are a number of other advantages which are worth mentioning. First of all, the bulk of the work entailed with crock pot cooking occurs early in the day when you're refreshed instead of at the conclusion of a hectic work or play day. This means that you're less likely to forget an ingredient or make other errors that often occur as we hurriedly prepare a dinner when we are tired from the activities of daily.

Second, many good crock pot recipes include the vegetables that guarantee we are getting the nutrients we need. So frequently, when preparing a meal at the last minute, vegetables and other side dishes are made in favour of expedience. Crock pot cooking in many instances is a meal in one dish.

One other excellent reason to use a crock pot for the summer cooking is the ease of clean up.  Unlike vegetables and pans, many crock pot meals are made in one dish. This means that there will not be mountains of meals to be either hand cleaned or packed to the dishwasher (or in case you're like me-both) later. You can spend less time cleaning as you spent time slaving over a hot cooker. Oh wait! Ensure time slaving over a hot stove. After clean up is complete you can get back to enjoying the sun set, pursuing the lightening bugs with your little ones, or waiting for the first superstar.

While there'll be no one size fits all ideal cooking method, crock pot cooking comes very close. In case you've got a crock pot gathering dust somewhere at the back of your pantry it is time to get it out, dust in the off, and dig some amazing summertime crock pot cooking recipes.
