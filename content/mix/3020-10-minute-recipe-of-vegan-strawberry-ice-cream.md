You should also look at the fact that by not heating the house by employing your stove top or oven you're also avoiding your air conditioning (or other cooling methods) from working overtime to be able to compensate for the additional heat that other cooking methods introduce.

This makes crock pot cooking a win-win scenario since the expenses involved in operating a crock pot are much less compared to the costs involved in managing a stove or oven generally. Whether gas or electric, your cooker and oven are often considerable energy hogs. Add to the fact that you are not raising the warmth in your house by traditional means of cooking and you are using even less energy.

Another wonderful reason to use a crock pot for the summer cooking is that the ease of clean up.  Unlike pans and pans, many crock pot meals are created in 1 dish. This means that there won't be mountains of dishes to be either hand washed or loaded to the dishwasher (or if you're like me-both) afterwards. It's possible to spend less time cleaning only as you spent time slaving over a hot stove. Oh wait! Ensure time slaving over a hot stove. After clean up is complete you can contact enjoying the sun set, pursuing the lightening bugs along with your little ones, or even waiting for your first celebrity.

While there'll never be a 1 size fits all best cooking method, crock pot cooking comes really near. If you have a crock pot collecting dust somewhere in the rear of your pantry it's the right time to get out it, dust off, and dig some fantastic summertime crock pot cooking recipes.
