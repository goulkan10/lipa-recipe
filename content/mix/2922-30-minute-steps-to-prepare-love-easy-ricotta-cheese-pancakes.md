Getting A Healthy Eater

    
Camp cooking can be as complicated or simple as you want it to be. If you want to prepare quick and easy but healthy meals while you're camping, camp cooking does not even need to require a fire. However, if you're interested in ridding your camping excursion with a feast, then camp cooking can make it possible for you to make hot, healthy foods that are as great as you can make them at home in your kitchen.

Camp cooking does not need to be limited to sandwiches and baked potatoes wrapped in aluminum foil.  Almost any cooking method you use from the kitchen could be duplicated around the home. For instance, use a dutch oven or pit cooking to bake your food. You might also easily fry foods at a pan over a grill, or boil, braise and roast. What type of camping cookware is ideal for you? Camp cooking and clean-up may be easy or a hassle, and it all starts with great camping equipment.

Some pots/pans come in sets that partner collectively or"nest" for storage and even let you tuck a spoonful of gas within them. This really comes in handy once you're looking to save room while camping.

Following are some camping things to carry with you if you are thinking about preparing some meals around the campfire. These frequent kitchen items allow you to duplicate tasty meals as you are out of doors.


• Other of your favorite herbs and spices
• Cooking oil
• Pot holder
• Hand-held can opener
• Aluminum foil

• Cutting knives
• Cutting board
• Mixing bowl


In case you have just a few campers and are searching for some very simple camp cooking, try out the easy and speedy technique of tin may cooking. All you will need is a fresh tin can -- a one gallon size can works nicely. Your source of warmth can be a little campfire, or if wood burning is illegal, a small buddy burner will work nicely, which can be located at sporting good stores or online. Place your meal in the tin can and simply warm the contents of your can over a fire.  This technique works great for soups, beans and tuna fish.

A more time-consuming pub cooking technique which also produces tasty food is pit cooking. Pit cooking is good for items that could be wrapped in aluminum foil to be cooked.  It's also a wonderful camp cooking system if you are using a dutch oven or cast iron cookware. Pit cooking warms your food by heating rocks and coals which are buried in the ground. As the rocks cool , their emitted heat cooks the food. To pit cook, first dig a hole that's approximately three times bigger than your cookware. Line the pit with rocks and construct a fire in the middle. When the flame has burnt rapidly for about an hour, push the warm coals and stones into the center. Twist your wrapped food covered skillets on top of the rocks and coals and place on top. After a number of hours, you will have some delicious camp food to relish.
