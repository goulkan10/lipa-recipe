One other excellent reason to use a crock pot for the summertime cooking is that the ease of clean up.  Unlike vegetables and pans, many crock pot dishes are made in 1 dish. This means that there will not be mountains of meals to be either hand washed or packed to the dishwasher (or if you're like me-both) afterwards. You can spend less time cleaning just as you spent time slaving over a hot stove. Oh wait! Ensure no time slaving over a hot cooker. Once clean up is complete you can contact enjoying the sunshine set, pursuing the lightening bugs along with your small ones, or even waiting for your very first celebrity.
