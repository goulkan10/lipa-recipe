<i>Before you jump to Fried Mee Hoon recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about {<strong>The Basics of Being Healthy</strong>.</i>
Becoming A Healthy Eater

    
Camp cooking can be as complicated or simple as you would like it to be. If you want to prepare fast and simple but nutritious meals as you're swimming, camp cooking doesn't even need to need a fire. But if you are interested in ridding your camping excursion with a feast, then camp cooking can enable you to earn warm, healthy foods that are as great as you can make them at home in your kitchen.

Camp cooking doesn't have to be limited to sandwiches and baked potatoes wrapped in aluminum foil.  Just about any cooking system you use in the kitchen could be duplicated around the campfire. For instance, use a toaster or pit cooking to consume your meals. You might also easily bake foods at a pan over a grill, or boil, braise and beverage. What sort of camping cookware is ideal for you? Camp cooking and clean-up may be easy or a hassle, it all starts with great camping equipment.

Some pots/pans come in places that partner together or"nest" for storage and even let you tuck a canister of gas within them. This really also comes in handy once you're wanting to save room while camping.

Following are some camping items to carry with you if you are thinking about preparing some meals around the campfire. These frequent kitchen items will allow you to duplicate tasty meals as you're out of doorways.


• Other your favorite herbs and spices
• Cooking oil
• Pot holder
• Hand-held can opener
• Aluminum foil

• Cutting knives
• Cutting board
• Mixing bowl
• Paper or plastic silverware, plates and cups

When you have only a few campers and are looking for some simple camp cooking, try out the simple and speedy technique of tin may cooking. All you'll need is a clean tin can -- a 1 gallon size may works nicely. Your source of heat can be a small campfire, or when wood burning is illegal, a little buddy burner may work nicely, which can be seen at sporting good stores or online. Place your meal from the tin could and easily heat the contents of your can over a fire.  This technique works great for sauces, beans and tuna fish.

A more time-consuming camp cooking technique that also produces delectable meals is pit cooking. Pit cooking is wonderful for items which may be wrapped in aluminum foil to be cooked.  It's also a great camp cooking method if you're using a dutch oven or cast iron cookware. Pit cooking calms your food by heating rocks and coals which are concealed in the ground. As the stones cool off, their emitted heat cooks the meals. To pit cook, first dig a hole that's approximately three times bigger than your own cookware. Line the pit with stones and create a fire in the middle. Once the fire has burned rapidly for about an hourpush the hot coals and stone into the center. Layer your wrapped food or covered skillets in addition to the stones and coals and place more on top. After a couple of hours, you'll have some tasty camp food to enjoy.
