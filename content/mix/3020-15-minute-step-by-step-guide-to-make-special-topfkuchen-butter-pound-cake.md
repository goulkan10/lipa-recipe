Becoming A Healthy Eater

    
Camp cooking can be as complicated or simple as you would like it to be. If you want to prepare fast and easy but healthy meals as you're swimming, camp cooking does not even need to require a flame. But if you're interested in ridding your camping excursion having a feast, then camp cooking can enable you to make hot, healthy foods which are as great as you can create them at home in your own kitchen.

 Almost any cooking procedure you are using from the kitchen can be replicated around the home. For instance, use a dutch oven or pit cooking to consume your meals. You can also easily bake foods in a pan over a grill, or boil, braise and beverage. What type of camping cookware is ideal for you? Camp cooking and cleanup can be easy or a hassle, and it all starts with great camping equipment.

Some pots/pans come in places that mate jointly or"nest" for storage and also allow you to tuck a spoonful of gas within them. This also comes in handy when you're trying to save room while camping.

Listed below are some camping things to take with you if you're planning on preparing some meals around the campfire. These common kitchen items allow you to replicate yummy meals when you are out of doorways.


• Other your favorite herbs and spices
• Cooking oil
• Pot holder
• Hand-held can opener
• Aluminum foil

• Cutting knives
• Cutting board
• Mixing bowl
• Paper or plastic silverware, plates and cups

When you have just a few campers and are looking for some very simple camp cooking, try the easy and quick technique of tin can cooking. All you will need is a clean tin can -- a one gallon size can works nicely. Your source of warmth can be a small campfire, or when wood burning is illegal, a little buddy burner may work nicely, which can be seen at sporting good stores or online. Place your meal from the tin can and easily warm the contents of your own can over a flame.  This technique works great for sauces, beans and tuna fish.

A more time-consuming camp cooking technique which also produces delectable meals is pit cooking.  It's also a great camp cooking system if you're using a dutch oven or cast iron cookware. Pit cooking warms your meals by heating stones and coals which are buried in the floor. As the stones cool away, their emitted heat cooks the food. To pit cook, first dig a hole that is about three times bigger than your own cookware. Line the pit with stones and construct a fire in the center. When the flame has burnt rapidly for approximately an hour, push the warm coals and rocks into the middle. Twist your wrapped food or covered skillets on top of the rocks and coals and place on top. Following a couple of hours, you'll have some delicious camp food to enjoy.

Pound Cake is one of those old fashioned cake recipes that will always have place on my dessert table. I have created all sorts of variations on pound cake like my Million Dollar Pound Cake which includes (among other things) buttermilk to tenderize the crumb, and of course my Kentucky Butter. In a large bowl, cream butter, sugar, and shortening together with a hand mixer. Mix the eggs, one at a time, into the batter. In a medium bowl, combine the milk, lemon extract, and vanilla extract.
