Becoming A Healthy Eater

    
Camp cooking can be as elaborate or simple as you want it to be. If you would like to prepare fast and simple but nutritious meals as you're camping, camp cooking doesn't even have to require a fire. However, if you're thinking about ridding your camping excursion with a feast, camp cooking can make it possible for you to make warm, healthy foods that are as great as you can make them at home in your kitchen.

 Just about any cooking process you use in the kitchen can be duplicated around the home. For instance, use a dutch oven or pit cooking to bake your food. You can also easily fry foods in a bowl over a grill, or boil, braise and beverage. Which sort of camping cookware is best for you? Camp cooking and clean-up can be easy or a hassle, but it all starts with great camping equipment.

Some pots/pans arrive in sets that mate together or"nest" for storage and even let you tuck a spoonful of fuel inside them. This really comes in handy once you're wanting to save room while camping.

Following are some camping items to consider with you if you are planning on preparing some meals around the campfire. These common kitchen items allow you to replicate yummy meals when you are out of doors.

• Salt and pepper
• Other of your favourite herbs and spices
• Cooking oil
• Pot holder
• Hand-held can opener
• Aluminum foil
• Tongs and spatula
• Cutting knives
• Cutting board
• Mixing bowl
• Paper or plastic silverware, plates and cups

When you have only a couple campers and are searching for some very simple camp cooking, try the easy and fast technique of tin may cooking. All you will need is a clean tin can -- a 1 gallon size may works well. Your source of heat can be a small campfire, or when wood burning is prohibited, a small buddy burner may work well, which can be seen at sporting good stores or online. Place your meal in the tin can and just warm the contents of your own can over a fire. You will have a hot meal ready in seconds.  This technique works great for sauces, beans and poultry.

A more time-consuming camp cooking technique that also produces yummy food is pit cooking.  It's also a excellent camp cooking method if you are using a dutch oven or cast iron cookware. Pit cooking warms your meals by heating rocks and coals that are buried in the floor. As the rocks cool away, their emitted heat cooks the food. To pit cook, first dig a hole that is about three times larger than your own cookware. Line the pit with stones and construct a fire in the middle. Once the flame has burnt rapidly for approximately one hourpush the hot coals and stones into the center. Layer your wrapped meals or covered skillets in addition to the rocks and coals and put more on top. After a couple of hours, you'll have some tasty camp food to relish.
