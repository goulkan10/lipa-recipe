This means that there isn't going to be mountains of meals to be hand cleaned or loaded to the dishwasher (or in case you're like me-both) later. It's possible to spend less time cleaning as you spent less time slaving over a hot cooker. Oh wait! Ensure time slaving over a hot cooker. Once clean up is complete you can get back to enjoying the sunshine set, pursuing the lightening bugs with your small ones, or waiting for your first celebrity.
