Camp cooking does not have to be limited to sandwiches and baked potatoes wrapped in aluminum foil.  Almost any cooking method you are using from the kitchen could be replicated around the campfire. For instance, use a dutch oven or pit cooking to bake your meals. You could also easily fry foods at a pan over a grill, or boil, braise and roast. Which kind of camping cookware is ideal for you?

When the flame has burnt rapidly for approximately an hourpush the hot coals and stones into the center. Layer your wrapped food or covered skillets in addition to the rocks and coals and place on top. After a few hours, you will have some tasty camp food to enjoy.
