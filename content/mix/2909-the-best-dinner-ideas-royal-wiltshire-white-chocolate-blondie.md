Becoming A Healthy Eater

    
Camp cooking can be as elaborate or simple as you want it to be. If you would like to prepare fast and simple but healthy meals as you're camping, camp cooking does not even have to require a flame. However, if you are thinking about ridding your camping trip using a feast, camp cooking can allow you to make warm, healthy foods that are as great as you can create them at home in your kitchen.

 Just about any cooking method you use from the kitchen could be duplicated around the campfire. For example, use a toaster or pit cooking to bake your food. You can also easily fry foods in a bowl over a grill, or boil, braise and roast. What type of camping cookware is best for you? Camp cooking and cleanup can be easy or a hassle, but it all starts with great camping gear.

Some pots/pans come in sets that mate together or"nest" for storage and also let you tuck a canister of gas within them. This really comes in handy when you're wanting to save room while camping.

Listed below are some camping things to consider with you if you are planning on preparing some meals around the campfire. These common kitchen items will allow you to replicate yummy meals while you are out of doors.


• Other your favorite herbs and spices
• Cooking oil
• Pot holder

• Aluminum foil
• Tongs and spatula
• Cutting knives
• Cutting board
• Mixing bowl


When you have only a few campers and are looking for some simple camp cooking, try the easy and quick technique of tin may cooking. All you'll need is a clean tin can -- a 1 gallon size can works well. Your source of heat can be a little campfire, or if wood burning is prohibited, a little buddy burner may work nicely, which can be located at sporting good stores or online. Place your meal in the tin could and easily warm the contents of your own can over a fire.  This technique works great for soups, beans and poultry.

A more time-consuming camp cooking technique that also produces delectable food is pit cooking.  It is also a wonderful camp cooking method if you're using a dutch oven or cast iron cookware. Pit cooking warms your meals by heating rocks and coals which are concealed in the ground. As the rocks cool off, their emitted heat cooks the meals. To pit cookfirst dig a hole that is about three times larger than your own cookware. Line the pit with stones and construct a fire in the middle. Once the fire has burnt rapidly for about one hourpush the warm coals and rocks into the middle. Twist your wrapped food or covered skillets in addition to the stones and coals and put more on top. After a few hours, you will have some tasty camp food to enjoy.
