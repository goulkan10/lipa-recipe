recipeingredient:
- " Crust"
- "2 cup Graham crackers crumbs"
- "1/4 cup melted butter"
- "1 can 14 oz Sweetened condensed milk"
- "1 lb ricotta cheese"
- "1 cup plain yoghurt"
- "3 large eggs"
- "1 tsp vanilla extract"
- "1 pinch salt"
- " Topping"
- "1/2 cup chopped hazelnuts"
- "1/4 cup granulated sugar"
recipeinstructions:
- "First, turn the sweetened condensed milk into Dulce de Leche through the boiling method indicated below. You may do this days in advance and have it stored. (You may also prepare your own or have it store bought.)"
- "Preheat the oven at 200ºC/ 400ºF. Prepare the crust. Mix the crumbs with melted butter and press firmly in an 8-inch (20 cm) springform pan, which has been lined with aluminium foil or baking paper. Bake for 5-10 minutes until it turns nice golden brown. Remove from oven and DECREASE THE OVEN TEMP TO 150ºC/ 300º F."
- "Next beat the yoghurt and ricotta cheese for a few minutes until smooth and creamy."
- "Then add the  Dulce de Leche and beat until well incorporated."
- "Next add the eggs one at a time. Last add the vanilla extract and the pinch of salt. Pour the mixture into the cooled crust. Place in the oven for 50-60 minutes. By the time the cheesecake is done, it should have risen around the edges and be a bit runny in the middle."
- "I leave the cheesecake to cool inside the oven with the door ajar for about an hour. It will deflate into a smooth surface."
- "While the cheesecake cools prepare the topping. Chop the hazelnuts (you may substitute with pecans or macadamia nuts if you prefer.)"
- "Place the sugar in a small pan in medium heat. Watch it caramelize and don&#39;t let it burn. Once caramelized, throw the hazelnuts quickly and with a spoon try to cover all with the caramel before it hardens. Next transfer into a plate and let them cool."
- "Before placing the cheesecake in the fridge, take the caramelized hazelnuts, crumble them and place on top of the cheesecake. Best to let it set overnight or until it has chilled."
- "I know that it may look like a lot of work but the end result is so tasty and creamy that it&#39;s worth it. Hope you enjoy!"

Getting A Healthy Eater

    
Camp cooking can be as complicated or simple as you would like it to be. If you want to prepare quick and easy but nutritious meals when you are camping, camp cooking does not even need to need a flame. However, if you are thinking about fueling your camping trip using a feast, camp cooking can allow you to make warm, healthy foods that are as great as you can make them at home in your kitchen.

Camp cooking does not have to be limited to sandwiches and baked potatoes wrapped in aluminum foil.  Just about any cooking procedure you use from the kitchen could be duplicated around the home. For example, use a dutch oven or pit cooking to consume your meals. You could also easily fry foods in a bowl over a grill, or boil, braise and roast. Which kind of camping cookware is ideal for you? Camp cooking and clean-up can be easy or a hassle, it all starts with great camping gear.

Some pots/pans arrive in sets that mate together or"nest" for storage and even let you tuck a spoonful of gas within them. This comes in handy when you're searching to save room whilst camping.

Following are some camping things to consider with you if you are thinking about preparing some meals around the home. These frequent kitchen items allow you to replicate yummy meals when you're out of doors.


• Other of your favourite herbs and spices
• Cooking oil
• Pot holder
• Hand-held can opener
• Aluminum foil
• Tongs and spatula
• Cutting knives
• Cutting board
• Mixing bowl


When you have only a few campers and are looking for some very easy camp cooking, try out the easy and quick technique of tin may cooking. All you will need is a fresh tin can -- a 1 gallon size may works nicely. Your source of heat can be a little campfire, or when wood burning is illegal, a little buddy burner may work well, which can be located at sporting good stores or online. Place your meal from the tin can and simply heat the contents of your can over a fire. You'll have a hot meal ready in minutes.  This technique works great for sauces, beans and poultry.

A more time-consuming pub cooking technique that also produces yummy food is pit cooking. Pit cooking is very good for items that may be wrapped in aluminum foil to be cooked.  It is also a wonderful camp cooking method if you're using a dutch oven or cast iron cookware. Pit cooking calms your meals by heating rocks and coals which are buried in the floor. As the rocks cool away, their emitted heat cooks the meals. To pit cookfirst dig a hole that is roughly three times larger than your cookware. Line the pit with stones and build a fire in the middle. Once the flame has burned rapidly for approximately an hour, push the warm coals and stones into the middle. Layer your wrapped meals covered skillets in addition to the stones and coals and put on top. Following a number of hours, you'll have some tasty camp food to relish.
