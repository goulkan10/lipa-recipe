recipeingredient:
- "3 cup basmati rice uncooked"
- "3 tbsp coconut oil"
- "2 large carrots diced"
- "1 tbsp black mustard seed"
- "1/2 cup peanuts"
- "1/2 cup cashew nuts bits and halves"
- "1/2 cup moong dal"
- "1/2 cup desi channa dal"

- "1 tbsp turmeric"
- "1/2 tsp cumin seeds"
- "1/2 tsp ground ginger"
- "1 tbsp asafoetida"
- "1 tsp cardamon pods green and bruised"
- "2 tbsp ghee"
- "1 cup green peas"
- "2 handfuls cilantro chopped"
recipeinstructions:
- "OK, cook the basmati rice. It&#39;s two to 1, people. Two cups water for every cup of basmati. So, 3 cups rice means 6 cups water, equaling 6 cups cooked. Set aside in open air to cool and dry a bit."
- "Melt the 3 tablespoons of coconut oil into a large wok on low. If you don&#39;t have one, you should get one as it is super versatile pan."
- "Toss in the carrots and mustard seeds, and let that simmer until the seeds start to crackle a little."
- "Ok, now toss in the nuts and dals. Let those toast (not burn; be careful) stirring intermittently another 5 minutes, and then toss in the chilis and salt."
- "Now let&#39;s make it interesting and add the curry leaves, turmeric, cumin, ginger, asafoetida, and bruised green cardamon. Note: Curry powder is a totally different thing; don&#39;t use it here. Also Note: Cardamon pods are barely edible, so you may want to pick them out after they&#39;ve simmered a while, if that&#39;s the way you roll. Simmer for a couple of minutes."
- "Now add in the ghee and peas and simmer for another 3 minutes or so."
- "Mix in the rice! Try to get it mixed thoroughly with gentle hands and only as much as necessary. You aren&#39;t out to make rice paste."
- "Now add in the cilantro (gentle hands), add more salt as needed to taste, and serve. Note: In fried rice, salt has a way of taking a few minutes to really bloom. As such, you may accidentally add more salt when you should have waited a moment for it to integrate, thereby making it salty. Don&#39;t be that guy; be patient."

It is possible for people to make healthy food options even if they simply have a short period to prepare their own foods. The first thing to realize is that it's often that healthy choices don't always signify a need for ab foods. Someone could choose healthy foods that are fast and simple to prepare at home or to pick out of a takeout location.

A number of these food vendors now include healthy alternatives to their standard fast-food selection.

At locations like McDonald's and Hardee's, it is possible to find consumers that are worried about their carbohydrate intake.  It has prompted the restaurants to give other options within their hamburger choices. Hamburgers could be arranged without the bun, for example, and fruit and yogurt are contained on the menu together with fresh cakes. Many restaurants offer salad choices either as side orders or as total meals.  Salads are particularly appealing in the summertime because they are lighter on the digestive system.

Restaurants that contain foods in season cultivated by local farmers provide very healthy and affordable choices. Some of such restaurants will create their own recipes for healthy food choices.  This gives the user with a completely fresh selection and encourages them to visit the restaurant again.

If home preparation of meals is favored, the options for healthy decisions grow. Seeing a neighborhood grocery store or grocery store emphasizes the amount of healthy choices that are available. Fresh fruits and vegetables are more diverse than ever before due to developments in transport and preservation methods.  All sorts of cuisine may be prepared quickly because of the choices of new goods instead of frozen foods. There are numerous choices among frozen foods too. The demand for healthy frozen dinners and other meals has increased along with demands for more variety in food that is frozen supplies. Any frozen food aisle in any supermarket will reveal as numerous healthy food alternatives and poor choices. The choice is up to the person.
