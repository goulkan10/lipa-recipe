<i>Before you jump to Layered Butter Pecan Cake recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about {<strong>The Simple Ways to Be Healthy</strong>.</i>
Becoming A Healthy Eater


When the weather outside warms up, the kitchen can be a horrible place to be. There are a number of things that you can do yet, when it comes to cooking a great home made meal which does not need traditional stove top or oven cooking. Learn to utilize some of these lesser heat generating equipment in your own kitchen, such as the crock pot, to be able to genuinely beat the summer heat and keep your cool while preparing a great warm meal for friends and family.

So, how can crock pot cooking really help overcome the heat? Simply put, that the crock pot in and of itself sets off much less heat compared to cooking than an oven or stove top. Here is the first and maybe the best reason to use the crock pot on summer time meal planning. You should also look at the fact that by not heating the house by utilizing your stove or oven you're also avoiding your air conditioning (or other cooling systems ) from working overtime so as to compensate for the additional heat which other cooking methods introduce.

This makes crock pot cooking a win-win situation as the costs involved with operating a crock pot are much less than the expenses related to managing a cooker or stove generally. Whether gas or electric, your cooker and oven are often considerable energy hogs. Add to the fact that you're not raising the temperature in your home by traditional way of cooking and you are using less power.

Unfortunately for many, the general consensus has been the crock pots were meant for comfort foods and hearty winter meals.  The simple reality is that the crock pot ought to be one of your most loved and most often utilized cooking techniques in case you're able to manage it.  Almost anything that can be baked can be produced in the crock pot and many, many more wonderful and enticing foods and snacks as well.



In addition to the cost benefits cited previously when it comes to crock pot cooking there are many different advantages which are worth mentioning. First of all, the bulk of the work involved in crock pot cooking occurs early in the afternoon when you're refreshed rather than at the conclusion of a hectic work or play day. This means that you are less inclined to forget an ingredient or make other errors which frequently happen as we hurriedly prepare a dinner when we are exhausted in the activities of our day.

Secondly, many good crock pot recipes include the vegetables that guarantee we're getting the nutrients we need. So often, when planning a meal in the last moment, vegetables and other side dishes have been made in favor of expedience. Crock pot cooking many instances is really a meal in one dish.

 Unlike pots and pans, many crock pot foods are made in 1 dish. This usually means that there will not be mountains of dishes to be either hand cleaned or loaded into the dishwasher (or in case you're like me-both) afterwards. You can spend less time cleaning just as you spent less time slaving over a hot cooker. Oh wait! Ensure time slaving over a hot stove. Once clean up is complete you can contact enjoying the sun set, chasing the lightening bugs along with your small ones, or waiting for the first celebrity.

While there will never be a one size fits all best cooking process, crock pot cooking comes really close. If you've got a crock pot collecting dust somewhere in the back of your pantry it is the right time to get out it, dust if off, and dig up some amazing summer crock pot cooking recipes.

When cool, blend remaining pecans with Creamy Butter Frosting; spread between layers and on top. I made this cake for my parents birthdays which are a week apart because they both love butter pecan ice cream. It was a beautiful cake and it got lots of oh&#39;s and ah&#39;s at the party. Nutty Browned Butter Frosting meets tender pecan cake in this show-stopping three-layer dessert. When browning the butter for the frosting, pour the butter into a bowl as soon as it turns golden brown, or it will continue to cook and get too dark.
