Getting A Healthy Eater

    
Camp cooking can be as elaborate or simple as you want it to be. If you would like to prepare quick and simple but healthy meals while you are camping, camp cooking doesn't even need to require a fire. But if you're thinking about fueling your camping trip with a feast, then camp cooking can allow you to make warm, healthy foods which are as great as you can create them at home in your own kitchen.

 Almost any cooking procedure you are using from the kitchen could be replicated around the home. For instance, use a dutch oven or pit cooking to bake your meals. You can also easily fry foods at a pan over a grill, or boil, braise and beverage. Which type of camping cookware is ideal for you? Camp cooking and cleanup may be easy or a hassle, and it all starts with great camping gear.

Some pots/pans arrive in sets that partner together or"nest" for storage and even let you tuck a spoonful of fuel inside them. This really also comes in handy when you're seeking to save space while camping.

Following are some camping items to take with you if you're planning on preparing some meals around the home. These common kitchen items will allow you to replicate yummy meals as you're out of doorways.

• Salt and pepper
• Other your favourite herbs and spices
• Cooking oil
• Pot holder
• Hand-held can opener
• Aluminum foil

• Cutting knives
• Cutting board
• Mixing bowl


When you have only a couple of campers and are looking for some easy camp cooking, try the easy and fast technique of tin can cooking. All you will need is a clean tin can -- a 1 gallon size can works well. Your source of heat may be small campfire, or when wood burning is prohibited, a small buddy burner will work well, which may be located at sporting good stores or online. Put your meal in the tin can and simply warm the contents of your own can over a fire. You will have a hot meal ready in seconds.  This technique works great for soups, beans and tuna fish.

A more time-consuming pub cooking technique which also produces tasty meals is pit cooking.  It is also a wonderful camp cooking method if you're using a dutch oven or cast iron cookware. Pit cooking calms your meals by heating rocks and coals that are concealed in the ground. As the rocks cool , their emitted heat cooks the meals. To pit cook, first dig a hole that's about three times bigger than your own cookware. Line the pit with rocks and create a fire in the center. Once the fire has burned rapidly for about an hourpush the warm coals and rocks into the middle. Layer your wrapped meals or covered skillets on top of the rocks and coals and place on top. After a couple of hours, you'll have some delicious camp food to relish.
