Camp cooking doesn't need to be limited to sandwiches and baked potatoes wrapped in aluminum foil.  Almost any cooking procedure you are using from the kitchen can be replicated around the home. For example, use a toaster or pit cooking to bake your food. You might also easily bake foods at a bowl over a grill, or boil, braise and beverage. Which kind of camping cookware is best for you?

Layer your wrapped meals or covered skillets on top of the stones and coals and place more on top. Following a number of hours, you'll have some tasty camp food to enjoy.
