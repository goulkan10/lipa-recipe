- "Your lobster shell should have a nice dark orange color and your lobster meat should be cooked."
- "While grilling lobster you should also grill your shrimp kabobs. If you can&#39;t tell when the kabobs are done cooking maybe you should not be eating this. Just kidding but they do cook quick but you will want to leave them a slight bit longer go have peppers and onions grill."
