Becoming A Healthy Eater

    
Camp cooking can be as elaborate or simple as you want it to be. If you want to prepare fast and easy but nutritious meals while you are swimming, camp cooking does not even have to need a fire. But if you are interested in fueling your camping trip having a feast, then camp cooking can enable you to make warm, healthy foods that are as good as you can create them at home in your own kitchen.

Camp cooking doesn't have to be limited to sandwiches and baked potatoes wrapped in aluminum foil.  Just about any cooking process you are using in the kitchen can be duplicated around the campfire. For instance, use a toaster or pit cooking to bake your meals. You may also easily fry foods in a pan over a grill, or boil, braise and beverage. What kind of camping cookware is ideal for you? Camp cooking and cleanup can be easy or a hassle, and it all starts with great camping gear.

Some pots/pans arrive in sets that mate collectively or"nest" for storage and also let you tuck a canister of gas within them. This really also comes in handy once you're searching to save space whilst camping.

Listed below are some camping items to consider with you if you're considering preparing some meals around the campfire. These frequent kitchen items allow you to duplicate tasty meals as you're out of doorways.


• Other of your favorite herbs and spices
• Cooking oil
• Pot holder
• Hand-held can opener
• Aluminum foil

• Cutting knives
• Cutting board
• Mixing bowl


If you have just a couple of campers and are looking for some very easy camp cooking, try out the easy and quick technique of tin could cooking. All you'll need is a clean tin can -- a 1 gallon size can works well. Your source of heat can be a small campfire, or when wood burning is prohibited, a small buddy burner will work nicely, which can be found at sporting good stores or online. Place your meal from the tin could and easily heat the contents of your can over a flame.  This technique works great for sauces, beans and tuna fish.

A more time-consuming pub cooking technique which also produces tasty food is pit cooking.  It's also a great camp cooking system if you are using a dutch oven or cast iron cookware. Pit cooking warms your meals by heating rocks and coals which are concealed in the floor. As the rocks cool off, their emitted heat cooks the food. To pit cookfirst dig a hole that's about three times bigger than your cookware. Line the pit with rocks and construct a fire in the center. Once the flame has burnt rapidly for about one hour, push the hot coals and stones into the middle. Twist your wrapped meals or covered skillets on top of the stones and coals and place more on top. After a couple of hours, you'll have some tasty camp food to enjoy.
