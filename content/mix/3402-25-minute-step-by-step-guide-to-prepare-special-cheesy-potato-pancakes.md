Getting A Healthy Eater

    
Camp cooking can be as complicated or simple as you want it to be. If you want to prepare quick and simple but healthy meals as you are camping, camp cooking doesn't even need to require a flame. But if you are interested in ridding your camping trip having a feast, camp cooking can allow you to make warm, healthy foods that are as good as you can create them at home in your own kitchen.

 Just about any cooking process you use in the kitchen can be replicated around the home. For example, use a dutch oven or pit cooking to bake your meals. You might also easily fry foods in a pan over a grill, or boil, braise and roast. Which type of camping cookware is ideal for you? Camp cooking and cleanup can be easy or a hassle, and it all starts with great camping equipment.

Some pots/pans arrive in sets that partner jointly or"nest" for storage and also allow you to tuck a canister of fuel inside them. This also comes in handy when you're trying to save space whilst camping.

Listed below are some camping items to consider with you if you're planning on preparing some meals around the campfire. These common kitchen items will allow you to duplicate tasty meals while you are out of doors.


• Other your favorite herbs and spices
• Cooking oil
• Pot holder
• Hand-held can opener
• Aluminum foil
• Tongs and spatula
• Cutting knives
• Cutting board
• Mixing bowl
• Paper or plastic silverware, plates and cups

If you have just a few campers and are searching for some easy camp cooking, try out the simple and quick technique of tin can cooking. All you will need is a fresh tin can -- a 1 gallon size may works nicely. Your source of heat can be a little campfire, or if wood burning is prohibited, a little buddy burner may work nicely, which may be located at sporting good stores or online. Place your meal from the tin can and easily warm the contents of your own can over a flame.  This technique works great for soups, beans and poultry.

A more time-consuming camp cooking technique that also produces tasty meals is pit cooking. Pit cooking is good for items which may be wrapped in aluminum foil to be cooked.  It's also a excellent camp cooking system if you are using a dutch oven or cast iron cookware. Pit cooking warms your meals by heating stones and coals which are concealed in the ground. As the rocks cool away, their emitted heat cooks the meals. To pit cookfirst dig a hole that is approximately three times bigger than your cookware. Line the pit with rocks and construct a fire in the middle. Once the flame has burned rapidly for about an hourpush the hot coals and stone into the middle. Layer your wrapped food or covered skillets in addition to the stones and coals and put more on top. After a couple of hours, you will have some delicious camp food to relish.

Because I know this is exactly what you. For these pancakes the potatoes are not cooked in advance but grated and squeezed well of any excess liquid. This step is really important to ensure getting delicious crispy pancakes on the outside. Using a box grater, shred the potatoes into a towel in a bowl and squeeze out as much liquid as possible. These Cheesy Mashed Potato Pancakes are so simple to make — just some leftover mashed potatoes (or freshly mashed!) and a handful of ingredients, a hot griddle, and a flipper.
