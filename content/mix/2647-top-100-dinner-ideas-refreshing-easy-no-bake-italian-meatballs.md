Mix all ingredients in a large bowl by hand. Use your bare hands for best results. Roll meatballs to about the size of a golf ball. (wet your hands to prevent the meat from sticking to them while rolling the meat balls). Drop raw meatballs into large (I use a stock pot) pot of sauce. Mix bread crumbs, Romano cheese, parsley, salt, pepper, garlic powder, and onion powder together.
