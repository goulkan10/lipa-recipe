The noodles are pretty &#34;bite-ty&#34; and the chicken feet mushroom stew gravy exudes a pleasant aroma. The noodles are smooth, easy for those who prefer to slurp their noodles. Be careful though of the gravy, which could splash off of the silky-smooth noodle surfaces. Finally, we found that the Shiitake mushroom and chicken feet well marinated. It is often described as a kwetiau version of the popular mie ayam (chicken noodles), and especially common in Indonesia, and can trace its origin to Chinese cuisine.
