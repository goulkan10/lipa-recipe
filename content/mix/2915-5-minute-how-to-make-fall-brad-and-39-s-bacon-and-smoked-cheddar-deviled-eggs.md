Becoming A Healthy Eater


When the weather warms warms up, the kitchen can be a horrible place to be. There are many things you can do however, in regards to cooking a nice homemade meal which does not require traditional stove top or oven cooking. Learn to use some of those lesser heat generating equipment in your own kitchen, such as the crock pot, to be able to truly beat the summertime and keep your cool when preparing a great hot meal for friends and loved ones.

So, how can crock pot cooking actually help overcome the heat? In other words, that the crock pot in and of itself puts off far less heat compared to cooking than the oven or stove top. This is the first and possibly the very best reason to use the crock pot in summer time meal preparation. You should also look at the fact that by not heating your home by using your stove or oven you are also avoiding your air conditioning (or alternative cooling systems ) from working overtime in order to compensate for the extra heat which other cooking methods introduce.

This makes crock pot cooking a win-win situation since the costs involved with managing a crock pot are much less than the expenses related to managing a cooker or stove in general. Whether electric or gas, your stove and oven tend to be significant energy hogs. Add to this the fact that you are not increasing the temperature in your home by conventional way of cooking and you are using even less energy.

 The reality is that the crock pot should be one of the most loved and most often utilized cooking methods in the event you're able to handle it.  Almost anything that can be baked can be made in the crock pot and many, many more wonderful and enticing meals and snacks too.

Advantages of Crock Pot Cooking

Along with the cost advantages cited above as it pertains to crock pot cooking there are quite a few different advantages which are well worth mentioning. First of all, the bulk of the work involved with crock pot cooking takes place early in the day when you're refreshed instead of at the end of a hectic work or play day. This means that you are not as likely to forget a component or make other mistakes that frequently occur as we hurriedly prepare a dinner when we are exhausted from the actions of daily.

Second, many great crock pot recipes incorporate the vegetables that insure we're getting the nutrients we need. So frequently, when preparing a meal in the last minute, vegetables and other side dishes have been left out in favour of expedience. Crock pot cooking in many instances is a meal in one dish.

Another fantastic reason to use a crock pot for your summer cooking is the ease of clean up.  Unlike vegetables and pans, many crock pot dishes are created in one dish. This means that there is not going to be mountains of dishes to be hand cleaned or loaded to the dishwasher (or if you are like me-both) afterwards. You can spend less time cleaning only as you spent time slaving over a hot cooker. Oh wait! Make that no time slaving over a hot cooker. After tidy is complete you can contact enjoying the sun set, chasing the lightening bugs with your little ones, or even waiting for the first star.

While there will never be a one size fits all best cooking process, crock pot cooking comes very close. In case you've got a crock pot gathering dust somewhere at the back of your pantry it is time to get out it, dust off, and dig up some excellent summer crock pot cooking recipes.

A few years back, I brought my bacon cheddar deviled eggs to a work potluck. We laughed and schmoozed as the food quickly disappeared. Eggs should keep a consistent and low temperature. This is best achieved by placing their carton in the center of your fridge. Ham or other smoked pork products like bacon can be stored for up to a week, though this.
