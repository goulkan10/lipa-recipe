<i>Before you jump to Portuguese Island Shrimp (Spicy) recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about {<strong>The Simple Ways to Be Healthy</strong>.</i>
Becoming A Healthy Eater

    
Camp cooking can be as complicated or simple as you want it to be. If you wish to prepare quick and easy but healthy meals while you are camping, camp cooking does not even have to need a flame. But if you're interested in fueling your camping excursion with a feast, camp cooking can enable you to make warm, healthy foods that are as great as you can make them at home in your own kitchen.

Camp cooking doesn't need to be limited to sandwiches and baked potatoes wrapped in aluminum foil.  Almost any cooking system you are using from the kitchen can be replicated around the home. For instance, use a dutch oven or pit cooking to bake your food. You can also easily bake foods at a pan over a grill, or boil, braise and roast. What kind of camping cookware is best for you? Camp cooking and cleanup can be easy or a hassle, and it all starts with great camping equipment.

Some pots/pans come in sets that mate jointly or"nest" for storage and also let you tuck a canister of gas within them. This really also comes in handy once you're trying to save space while camping.

Listed below are some camping items to consider with you if you are considering preparing some meals around the campfire. These common kitchen items will allow you to replicate yummy meals while you are out of doors.

• Salt and pepper
• Other your favorite herbs and spices
• Cooking oil
• Pot holder

• Aluminum foil

• Cutting knives
• Cutting board
• Mixing bowl
• Paper or plastic silverware, plates and cups

If you have just a couple campers and are looking for some easy camp cooking, try out the simple and fast technique of tin could cooking. All you will need is a fresh tin can -- a one gallon size can works well. Your source of warmth can be a little campfire, or if wood burning is illegal, a small buddy burner may work well, which can be found at sporting good stores or online. Put your meal from the tin can and simply heat the contents of your own can over a flame. You will have a hot meal ready in seconds.  This technique works great for soups, beans and tuna fish.

A more time-consuming camp cooking technique that also produces delectable meals is pit cooking. Pit cooking is wonderful for items which can be wrapped in aluminum foil to be cooked.  It is also a wonderful camp cooking method if you're using a dutch oven or cast iron cookware. Pit cooking warms your food by heating rocks and coals which are buried in the ground. As the rocks cool off, their emitted heat cooks the meals. To pit cookfirst dig a hole that's about three times larger than your own cookware. Line the pit with rocks and create a fire in the center. When the fire has burned rapidly for about an hourpush the hot coals and stones into the middle. Layer your wrapped meals covered skillets on top of the rocks and coals and put more on top. Following a few hours, you will have some delicious camp food to relish.
