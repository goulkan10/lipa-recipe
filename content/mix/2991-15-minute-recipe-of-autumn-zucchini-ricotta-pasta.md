It&#39;s a nice light pasta supper perfect for any time of year. The zoodles with ricotta were good just not very exciting. Added zucchini and broccoli to the chicken and tomatoes and served it over Trader Joe s lemon pappardelle pasta. Fresh ricotta is the base for a silky and comforting cheese sauce, and zucchini brings texture, color and flavor that complement the pasta. While pasta cooks, warm a serving bowl and put ricotta in it, along with about half the basil.
