recipeingredient:
- "5 ripe tomatoes roughly chopped"
- "2 onions chopped"
- "2 small carrots chopped"
- "7 garlic cloves slightly smashed"
- "2 tbsp oregano"
- " chilli flakes"
- "1/2 tsp turmeric"
- " fresh cream"
- "50 ml tomato puree"
- "bunch spring onions"
- "bunch coriander leaves"
- "2 tbsp cooking butter"
- " salt"
recipeinstructions:
- "Heat the cooking butter in a pressure cooker. Don&#39;t let it brown too much."
- "Add the chopped onions and garlic to the melted butter and fry till the onions turn translucent."
- "Add the carrots. They need to stay in the pan longer because they have to soften considerably."
- "Then add the tomatoes to the mixture and fry till they start to come apart slightly."
- "Add the chopped coriander leaves, oregano, chilli flakes, turmeric and salt to the pressure cooker. Fry for an additional 2 to 3 minutes. After adding the salt, the tomatoes would start melting and start to give a saucy consistency to the mixture. Keep tasting everything to ensure the desired flavor is achieved."
- "Close the pressure cooker and let it cook for 10 mins (2 whistles). Let the steam escape in it&#39;s own pace and open the cooker to cool down the mixture."
- "After the contents have cooled, blend it in a mixer or using a blender. Now you can either strain the result in a soup strainer to remove the tomato seeds and skin that didn&#39;t get disintegrated (guarantees the smoothness usually associated with soup) or use the blended mixture as it is. I prefer to use the non strained version as it gives a thicker consistency and great texture without wasting anything."
- "Now pour the soup back into a pan. Add the tomato puree to enhance the tomato flavour and bring to a boil. Then add the fresh cream to make the soup thick and rich."
- "Finally, chop up some spring onions and mix it in. Serve with crisp croutons on top and grilled cheese sandwiches on the side."

Becoming A Healthy Eater

It's possible for people to make healthy food options even when they just have a short period to prepare their meals. The first thing to realize is that it's often that healthy choices do not always signify a need for meals that are aerated. Someone can pick healthy foods that are quick and easy to prepare in your home or even to pick out of a takeout area. Cities frequently offer restaurant guides in their telephone books that show full-page menus indicating what a particular restaurant or drive-thru offers. Many of these food vendors now include healthy alternatives for their standard fast-food selection.

At locations like McDonald's and Hardee's, it's possible to find consumers who are concerned in their carbohydrate consumption.  It has motivated the restaurants to offer different options within their burger choices. Hamburgers could be arranged with no bun, for example, and fruit and yogurt are contained on the menu along with fresh cakes. Many restaurants offer salad options either as unwanted orders or as whole meals.  Salads are particularly appealing in the summertime as they're milder on the digestive system.

Restaurants that contain foods in season cultivated by local farmers provide quite healthy and affordable choices. Some of these kinds of restaurants will make their own recipes for healthy food options.  This provides the customer with a totally fresh choice and promotes them to go to the restaurant again.

If house preparation of food is favored, the options for healthy choices grow. Visiting a local grocery store or grocery store emphasizes the number of healthy choices that are available. Fresh fruits and vegetables are more varied than ever before due to improvements in transportation and preservation procedures.  All types of cuisine can be prepared quickly due to the options of fresh goods rather than frozen foods. There are numerous choices among frozen foods as well. The demand for healthy frozen dishes and other meals has increased along with demands for much more variety in food that is frozen supplies. Any frozen food aisle in almost any supermarket will reveal as several healthy food choices and bad choices. The decision is up to the individual.

People can either opt to eat a healthy diet plan or an unhealthy one. Time and availability of healthy alternatives are no longer problems for a person who's trying to eat healthy and healthier foods.
