This usually means that there will not be mountains of meals to be hand cleaned or packed to the dishwasher (or in case you're like me-both) afterwards. You can spend less time cleaning only as you spent time slaving over a hot stove. Oh wait! Ensure no time slaving over a hot stove. After clean up is complete you can contact enjoying the sunshine set, pursuing the lightening bugs with your small ones, or even waiting for your first celebrity.

I have been making sweet potato pancakes ever since my youngest started solids. Sweet potato pancakes have been calling my name and I just couldn&#39;t resist. I eat a sweet potato nearly everyday and enjoy sprinkling them with cinnamon, peanut butter maple syrup. Our sweet potato pancakes are made with mashed sweet potatoes and a touch of spice. Top the pancakes with flavored butter or syrup.
