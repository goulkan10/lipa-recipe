 Unlike vegetables and pans, most crock pot foods are created in one dish. This usually means that there isn't going to be mountains of dishes to be either hand washed or loaded to the dishwasher (or in case you are like me-both) afterwards. It is possible to spend less time cleaning only as you spent time slaving over a hot stove. Oh wait! Make that time slaving over a hot cooker. Once clean up is complete you can contact enjoying the sunshine set, pursuing the lightening bugs along with your small ones, or even waiting for the first star.

The idea of this mini brownie butter cake is pretty simple. The bottom part is everyone&#39;s favorite brownie, and the top part is rich butter cake. To make these mini brownie butter cake into full-blown cupcakes, my contributor drizzled them with some chocolate sauce and topped with some sprinkles. For the cake, use any chocolate brownie mix, separate the batter in two and bake until just cooked through. After you&#39;ve let the pans cool, pipe the peanut butter fudge frosting on both tiers and sprinkle with chopped peanuts.
