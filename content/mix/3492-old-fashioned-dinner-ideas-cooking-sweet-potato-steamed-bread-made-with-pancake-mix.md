So often, when preparing a meal in the last moment, vegetables and other side dishes have been made in favor of expedience. Crock pot cooking in many instances is really a meal in 1 dish.

One other great reason to use a crock pot for your summertime cooking is that the ease of clean up.  Unlike vegetables and pans, most crock pot foods are made in one dish. This usually means that there is not going to be mountains of dishes to be hand washed or loaded into the dishwasher (or in case you are like me-both) later. It is possible to spend less time cleaning just as you spent time slaving over a hot stove. Oh wait! Ensure no time slaving over a hot cooker. Once tidy is complete you can get back to enjoying the sunshine set, pursuing the lightening bugs along with your small ones, or even waiting for the very first star.

While there will be no 1 size fits all ideal cooking method, crock pot cooking comes really near. If you have a crock pot collecting dust somewhere in the back of your pantry it is time to get it out, dust offand dig some amazing summer crock pot cooking recipes.
