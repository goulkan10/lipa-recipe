Great for a weeknight when you don&#39;t have a lot of time to make homemade sauce. I love how the meatballs &#34;poach&#34; in the sauce and flavor. In a large bowl, combine eggs, water, onion, bread crumbs, Parmesan cheese, garlic and seasonings; mix well. Crumble beef over mixture and mix well. While the meatballs are cooking, bring a large pan of salted water to the boil.
