recipeingredient:
- "3 lb boneless pork chop"
- "3/4 lb large red onion"
- "2 lb whole mango"
- "1 medium lemon"
- "1 bunch parsley"
- "4 tbsp extra virgin olive oil"
- "1 large radicchio"
- "2 head romaine lettuce"
- "1 medium navel orange"
recipeinstructions:
- "If you are using wooden or bamboo skewers, soak them in water. Keep them in the water until you need to start using them."
- "Peel your mango and remove the flesh. Cut the flesh into 1” cubed pieces. Put the mango into the mixing bowl and set it aside."
- "Peel the onion and cut it in half through the root end. To cut an onion so that the slices stay together and are easier to work with, rest the onion on its curved side and cut it from the flat, just-cut surface. Cut each half into 5 crescent-shaped slices, keeping the root end intact so the slices stay together."
- "Add the onion slices to the mixing bowl with the mango."
- "Remove the leaves from the parsley by cutting them off from the stems, then chop them finely. You should end up with between 4-6 tbsp of chopped parsley per bunch. Add half the parsley (about 2-3 tbsp) to the mixing bowl with the onion and the mango. Set the rest aside."
- "Use your vegetable peeler to remove 1 tbsp of zest (that&#39;s about 3 peeled strips) from the orange."
- "Cut the zest into fine strips and add it to the mixing bowl."
- "Cut the orange and lemon in half and set them aside."
- "Cut all of the pork into 1-inch cubes. Add the cubed pork to the mixing bowl."
- "Add 2 tbsp of olive oil and a 3 finger pinch of salt to the mixing bowl. Gently mix all the ingredients so that everything is evenly coated by the olive oil."
- "Skewer the pork, mango, and onion. You want to have 2 skewers per person. Each skewer should should have about .25 pound of pork on it."
- "Skewer everything so that there is about 1/8 inch of spacing between the ingredients. By leaving gaps between the ingredients, you ensure that the heat can reach all sides of the ingredients."
- "Layer your baking sheet or broiling pan with foil. Take a few sheets of foil and crumple them into &#34;rods&#34; that stretch the width of your sheet or pan. These rods will be what you rest the kebabs on."
- "Set your oven to “broil”."
- "Lay the kebabs over the foil rods."
- "Put the kebabs in the broiler."
- "Cook the kebabs for 6 minutes. After the 6 minutes is up flip the kebabs and cook them for another 6 minutes."
- "Cut the lettuce into 4 wedges that are held together by the core."
- "Do the same for the radicchio."
- "As soon as the kebabs are done, remove them from the pan or baking sheet and rest them on your cutting board."
- "Place the citrus, cut side up, and the lettuce and radicchio on the pan or baking sheet and drizzle it all with 1 tbsp of olive oil."
- "Broil the salad for 4-6 minutes."
- "This meal is best served family style. Pile the kebabs onto a plate and set them at the table. Place the lettuce and radicchio on a plate. Drizzle them with the remaining 1 Tbsp of olive oil and sprinkle them with the remaining parsley. Place the citrus on the plate next to the lettuce and set it at the table. Squeeze the citrus on the lettuce table side."
- "Boom! You&#39;re done! Feast like the broiling champion you are! Don&#39;t forget to share your photos with us on Facebook or Twitter at @letsfeast and check out http://letsfeast.com for more online cooking lessons."
