Add lasagna to one of your lists below, or create a new one. Lasagna noodles need structure—they have a lot of ingredients layered between them!—so they can&#39;t be too mushy. Make sure to cook them until they&#39;re very al dente; they&#39;re ready typically two minutes. It tastes nothing like the ones from the frozen food aisle. Lasagna Pasta Shortcut: Boiling lasagna noodles is an extra step that we would all love to avoid.
