Pork chops shouldn&#39;t be served raw or rare so it&#39;s a good idea to test the meat with a skewer before serving - the juices should run clear. Check this at the thickest part or, if the chop is on the bone, test as close to the bone as you can as that area can take longer for the heat to permeate. Plus, it injects flavor into this mild-tasting meat! For the quick-cooking loin and rib chops, be very careful not to. If you have time, brining the pork for even a brief period adds flavor and ensures juiciness in the finished chop.
