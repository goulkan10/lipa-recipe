<i>Before you jump to Spinach and ricotta cheese with cannelloni recipe, you may want to read this short interesting healthy tips about {<strong>The Simple Ways to Be Healthy</strong>.</i>
Getting A Healthy Eater

    
Camp cooking can be as elaborate or simple as you want it to be. If you would like to prepare quick and easy but healthy meals while you are camping, camp cooking does not even need to need a flame. But if you're thinking about fueling your camping trip using a feast, then camp cooking can enable you to make warm, healthy foods that are as great as you can make them at home in your kitchen.

Camp cooking doesn't have to be limited to sandwiches and baked potatoes wrapped in aluminum foil.  Just about any cooking process you use from the kitchen could be replicated around the campfire. For example, use a dutch oven or pit cooking to consume your meals. You can also easily bake foods in a pan over a grill, or boil, braise and roast. What kind of camping cookware is best for you? Camp cooking and clean-up can be easy or a hassle, but it all starts with great camping gear.

Some pots/pans come in sets that mate together or"nest" for storage and even let you tuck a canister of gas within them. This really comes in handy when you're trying to save space while camping.

Following are some camping things to take with you if you are planning on preparing some meals around the campfire. These common kitchen items allow you to duplicate tasty meals when you're out of doorways.


• Other your favourite herbs and spices
• Cooking oil
• Pot holder
• Hand-held can opener
• Aluminum foil
• Tongs and spatula
• Cutting knives
• Cutting board
• Mixing bowl
• Paper or plastic silverware, plates and cups

If you have only a few campers and are searching for some very simple camp cooking, try out the simple and fast technique of tin could cooking. All you will need is a clean tin can -- a one gallon size may works nicely. Your source of warmth may be little campfire, or when wood burning is illegal, a little buddy burner may work well, which may be found at sporting good stores or online. Place your meal from the tin could and simply heat the contents of your can over a flame. You will have a hot meal ready in seconds.  This technique works great for soups, beans and tuna fish.

A more time-consuming pub cooking technique that also produces tasty food is pit cooking.  It's also a great camp cooking method if you're using a dutch oven or cast iron cookware. Pit cooking warms your meals by heating rocks and coals that are buried in the ground. As the stones cool , their emitted heat cooks the meals. To pit cook, first dig a hole that's roughly three times larger than your own cookware. Line the pit with stones and build a fire in the center. Once the fire has burnt rapidly for about an hour, push the warm coals and stones into the middle. Twist your wrapped meals covered skillets on top of the rocks and coals and place on top. Following a number of hours, you'll have some delicious camp food to relish.
